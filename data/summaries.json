    "Summary": {
      "Grading": "The feedback on grading indicates that the tests are fair and the homework is sometimes disjoint from what is covered in lectures. Some students suggested that a portion of the grade should be tied to participation, either in class or on Canvas boards. They felt that the Canvas discussion boards were not particularly helpful. There were also suggestions to limit the homework to one per week due to the length and time required to complete them. ",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, some students found the homework assignments to be long and time-consuming. They suggested limiting the homework to one per week. The feedback also indicated that the end of the class sometimes felt rushed, with one or two slides often left for students to go over on their own. However, the availability of weekly office hours was appreciated. ",
      "Teaching Style": "Regarding teaching style, Professor McClure was highly praised for his engaging lectures, clear explanations, and use of real-world examples. He was also commended for his responsiveness to feedback and commitment to helping students succeed. His pre-recorded lectures and practice materials were found to be very helpful. However, some students felt that he could improve by explaining how different financial statements are linked to each other and by highlighting the underlying structure and thought process when designing accounting standards. ",
      "Difficulty Level": "The course was found to be of varying levels of difficulty depending on the students' background and experience. Some students with no financial background found the course easy, while others found it challenging. The course was described as manageable, even for those with no prior experience. The initial classes were perceived as hard, but students felt it got easier with time. The computational difficulty was considered low, with the actual math being simple. The challenge was more in understanding which statements had which information and how to figure out information not explicitly listed on the statements. However, many practice opportunities were given, making it easy to learn."

    "Summary": {
      "Grading": "The feedback on grading for the course Building the New Venture was mixed. Some students found the grading to be fair and helpful, while others found it to be arbitrary and unclear. The TA, Trevor, was mentioned several times in relation to grading, with some students finding his feedback confusing and his grading measures unclear. Some students suggested that the grading could be improved by providing a clearer rubric or guidelines for what is expected in assignments.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the feedback was generally positive. Many students found the assignments to be the most beneficial part of the course, helping them to understand the steps involved in creating a startup. However, some students found the workload to be heavy at times, with assignments coming at them fast. Some students suggested that the workload could be managed better by having more class sessions per week, allowing for more time to cover the course material.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the instructor, CJ, was highly praised by many students. They found his lectures to be engaging, informative, and valuable, with his industry experience providing insights that couldn't be learned elsewhere. However, some students found the lectures to be too story-based and lacking in material content. Some students suggested that the teaching could be improved by spending more time outlining the key points in each lecture, and by providing more hard skills.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course was generally considered to be manageable, even for those with no prior startup experience. Some students found the course to be easy, while others found it to be more challenging depending on their level of seriousness and passion for their project. Some students suggested that the course could be improved by providing more case studies and allowing more time for the ideation stage."

    "Summary": {
      "Grading": "The feedback on the course Building the New Venture reveals that students learned a lot about the process of building a startup, including entrepreneurial skills, business politics, managing networks and interactions between teams, and the different stages of building a new venture. They also learned about business models, financial modeling, prototyping, and how to pitch effectively. The course also taught them how to work well in a group setting and how to make the marketing and sales of a business successful through the use of different case studies.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the feedback suggests that the homework assignments were very effective in reinforcing the information taught in the course. The meetings with the instructors also helped to cement the knowledge. However, some students felt that the course was too long, with 4.5 hours of lecture each week, and would have preferred a traditional 3-hour lecture with a 10-minute break once a week. The assignments were found to be helpful, especially the YourCo ones, as they were useful for fleshing out ideas and identifying potential obstacles.",
      "Teaching Style": "Regarding the teaching style, the instructor, CJ, was praised for his charisma, ability to make jokes to keep the classes interesting, and his experience as an entrepreneur. His lecture slides were found to be good and his discussions allowed students to participate and give their opinions about different marketing and sales strategies. However, some students wished that he posted the lecture slides and provided more direct feedback and time to work on their ventures.",
      "Difficulty Level": "In terms of difficulty, some students found the grading standards for some of the assignments unclear, especially for the cases. They also found it hard to integrate what they learned in class with the assignments due to the lack of posted lecture slides. Some students wished for more coverage of the financial side of business. The TA's teaching was generally appreciated, especially Elizabeth Zellner's availability and willingness to give feedback and walk students through the assignments. However, Adam Smith was criticized for not posting office hours availability and not thoroughly explaining his grades."

    "Summary": {
      "Grading": "The feedback on grading for the Developing a New Venture course was mixed. Some students appreciated the feedback they received on their pitches, but expressed a desire for more timely and frequent grading of assignments. They felt that knowing their standing in the class would provide a sense of security as they worked on their ventures. There were also suggestions for grading to be done earlier in the course, as some students were unsure of their grades at certain points.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the course was described as challenging but manageable. The majority of the class involved pitches, similar to the format of the television show Shark Tank, with a few lecture classes to teach unfamiliar terminology. Students found the lectures to be long but helpful, and the round-robin pitch day was seen as particularly beneficial for understanding what needed to be improved in their pitches. Assignments were seen as useful, but some students felt they were a bit rushed.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the course was generally well-received. Students appreciated the passion and engagement of the instructor, Starr, and found her office hours and individual meetings to be very helpful. The guest speakers brought in for the course were also highly praised. However, some students expressed concerns about receiving contradictory feedback from different coaches and mentors. They suggested that future students should use their own knowledge of their business or idea when filtering through the feedback received in the class.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course was seen as dependent on the amount of work students were willing to put into it. Some students with no entrepreneurship background but a decent finance background did not find the course very difficult, especially as they were working in teams. Others described the course as not inherently difficult, but challenging depending on how much effort was put into growing their startup. The course was described as unique and worth the effort if students were self-directed and motivated."

    "Summary": {
      "Grading": "The feedback on grading indicates that students found the exams to be challenging and time-consuming. Some students suggested that the difficulty of the exams could be slightly reduced to prevent grades from being influenced by how busy students are during the exam period. They also suggested a combination of timed and untimed assessments to balance the grading system. Feedback on assignments was mixed, with some students finding them helpful for understanding the concepts, while others suggested that they could be more reflective of what would be on the exams.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, students found the lectures to be long and fast-paced, but appreciated that all the information was available on the slides posted on Canvas. The homework assignments were seen as beneficial for solidifying understanding of the material. However, some students suggested that the teaching assistants should have more office hours, especially on the days when assignments are due. They also suggested that the review sessions could include more challenging questions to better prepare students for the exams.",
      "Teaching Style": "Regarding the teaching style, students praised the instructor's enthusiasm and ability to explain complex concepts in an intuitive way. They appreciated his use of real-life examples and his efforts to check for understanding during each class. However, some students suggested that the instructor could slow down and explain things more simply and intuitively. They also suggested that he could provide more feedback on assignments and post extra slides to help all students understand the material.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The feedback on the level of difficulty indicates that the course was challenging for students without a background in investments. The mathematical concepts were seen as manageable for students with a background in statistics and linear algebra, but the qualitative material was seen as more difficult. The midterm and final exams were seen as particularly challenging and time-consuming, requiring students to think outside the box and go beyond the course material. However, some students found the course to be approachable for beginners in finance, while others found it to be relatively difficult."

      "Grading": "The feedback on grading was generally positive, with students appreciating the fair grading system. The TA, Piotr Langer, was particularly commended for his detail-oriented approach and fair grading. However, there was no specific feedback on the grading system used by the instructor. The students learned a lot from the course, including fixed income, portfolio theory, market efficiency hypotheses, asset pricing models, modern portfolio theory, and the basics of fixed income. They also learned about forwards, futures, options, bond pricing, and how to build a portfolio with various risky/non-risky assets.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the students found the lectures and assignments helpful in their learning. The lectures were detailed and the problem sets allowed the students to solve problems related to the topics taught during the week. However, some students felt that most of the learning was from reading slides before exams. The homework involving Excel was found to be fun and meaningful. The students also appreciated the detailed slideshows and class notes. However, some students felt that the lectures could be more engaging.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the instructor, Professor Vandeweyer, was generally appreciated. He was commended for his knowledge of the topic and his ability to present it in a digestible way. The students particularly liked the slideshows and class notes because they were detailed yet concise. The instructor also kept up with recent developments in finance and sometimes mentioned what was happening in finance academia. However, some students felt that the instructor spent too much time on the easiest concepts and not enough time on multi-factor models, futures, and options. Some students also wished that the instructor would share more of his own opinions on topics.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The course was found to be of varying levels of difficulty. Some students found it not hard, but noted that the problem sets took a good amount of time. Others found it not difficult, while some found the difficulty far higher than expected despite having a decent catalogue of relevant courses in the past. Some students felt that having some quantitative background would be good but not necessary, as it can be learned with the right attitude. However, some students found the course pretty hard."

The exams were week-long take-home exams, which students found hard to manage alongside work for other classes. The final exam was also perceived to be significantly more difficult than past practice finals, which added to the stress of finals week.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, students found the course to be time-consuming. The homework assignments were generally straightforward and aided learning, but towards the end of the quarter, students felt that the homework covered areas that were not thoroughly discussed in class. The lectures were sometimes fast-paced, and students suggested that the instructor should go a little slower through the slides to allow them enough time to take notes.",
      "Teaching Style": "Regarding the teaching style, students appreciated the instructor's knowledge and passion for the material. They found his lectures to be clear and his explanations helpful. However, some students found the lectures and slides difficult to follow, as the theoretical concepts were explained quickly and without much additional detail. They suggested that the instructor could improve the quality of the slides and lectures, explain specific terminology more, and provide more intuitive explanations. They also suggested that the instructor could include more examples in the slides and cover some concepts more thoroughly.",
      "Difficulty Level": "In terms of difficulty, the course was perceived as challenging but manageable for students with a background in math and statistics. However, some students found the course to be shockingly difficult and more time-consuming than necessary. They suggested that taking statistics and economics courses beforehand or concurrently would be beneficial for this course. Despite the difficulty, students found the material interesting and were glad to have learned about the concepts of the course."

The TA discussions and assignments were also found to be helpful in discussing the material and solving it at the same time. Some students found the homework assignments challenging, but felt that the questions on the midterm and final were slightly easier and more intuitive.",
      "Teaching Style": "Regarding the teaching style, students appreciated the informative and clear lectures. They found the online lecture postings helpful and appreciated the willingness of the professor to help and discuss basic concepts. The investment game was also found to be interesting as it gave students a real-world experience of investing. However, some students felt that the lectures were a little boring and dense at times, and that there was a lot of information thrown at them. They also felt that the instructor had pre-established assumptions about their knowledge.",

    "Summary": {
      "Grading": "The feedback on grading for the Corporation Finance course was mixed. Some students found the grading system fair and appreciated the pass/fail approach to homework assignments, which allowed them to focus on learning rather than grades. However, some students expressed concerns about the weightage of the final exam, which accounted for 60% of the grade. This caused significant anxiety for some students, especially those who had personal issues or emergencies during the midterm. There were also suggestions for more review sessions before exams and a practice final that closely mirrors the actual final exam.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the feedback was generally positive. Most students found the workload manageable and reasonable. However, some students felt that the pace of the course was too fast, especially at the beginning of the quarter, making it difficult to absorb all the information. There were also suggestions for more time to study for the final exam, with some students preferring to have the final during finals week rather than in week 9. Some students also felt that the time spent on project presentations was excessive and could have been better used for learning new content.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the professor received mixed reviews. While many students appreciated the professor's enthusiasm, engagement, and deep understanding of the course material, some found his lectures confusing and hard to follow. There were complaints about the professor's use of verbal crutches and distractions, such as being on his phone during class. Some students also felt that the professor could improve his teaching by being more thorough in working through practice problems and providing more examples, especially for new and complex topics. The use of case studies and guest lectures was generally well-received.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course was seen as manageable by most students, especially those with a background in finance or related fields. However, some students found the mathematical concepts difficult to grasp and felt that the course was more suited to those pursuing a career in finance. There were suggestions for clearer slides and more informative slideshows to aid learning. Some students also wished for more content on topics like Mergers and Acquisitions. Overall, the course was seen as useful and interesting, but some students felt that it could be improved in terms of teaching style and pacing."

      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the feedback was mixed. Some students found the lectures and case studies to be the most beneficial to their learning, while others found the optional problem sets to be the most helpful. However, there were concerns about the pace of the lectures, with some students finding them too fast and confusing. This led to some students having to teach themselves most of the course content to keep up. There were also concerns about the relevance of the case studies to the exams, with some students feeling that they only somewhat applied in a quantitative way.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the instructor received mixed reviews. Some students found the case study reviews, examples drawn on the whiteboard, and the lectures to be the most beneficial to their learning. However, others felt that the instructor's fast-paced teaching style made it difficult to keep up and understand the material. There were also concerns about the lack of detailed information on the lecture slides, with some students suggesting that more detailed slides would be helpful for those who missed lectures or didn't catch everything. There were also suggestions for better introductions to each topic before delving into the theory.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course was perceived as high by some students, particularly those with no prior background in finance. These students felt that they had to do a lot of catching up to their peers and wished the course was more accessible to students like them. However, others found the content easy to grasp but found the implementation on exams more difficult. There were also comparisons made to other finance courses, with some students finding the course as difficult as investments or financial accounting."

There were also suggestions for more accurate practice material for the final and midterm exams, and for posting the midterm solutions.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, students found the course manageable and well-structured. They appreciated the variety of learning methods including lectures, case studies, problem sets, and a final project. The case discussions and guest speakers were particularly engaging. However, some students found the final valuation project fun but quite unrelated to the course. There was also a suggestion for longer office hours, preferably not at 8:30 in the morning.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the course was highly praised. The professor was described as a clear lecturer with good slides, who was very supportive of the students. The use of current events to give purpose to the learning was particularly appreciated. However, there was a suggestion for more explanation of concepts instead of just reading what is on the board. The teaching assistant, David Zhang, was also praised for his availability and fast response to emails. However, there was a suggestion for standing office hours for in-person questions, and for more in-depth exam review sessions.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course was generally considered reasonable and manageable, even for those with no prior knowledge of finance. However, some students with no background in finance found the course difficult, especially compared to those with a strong foundation in the course material.

Despite these issues, the professor was praised for being kind and receptive to questions.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the feedback was mixed. Some students found the course content manageable and appreciated the use of real-world examples to illustrate concepts.

One student suggested that the time spent on case studies could be reduced to allow for more in-depth exploration of new material.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the professor received mixed reviews. Some students found the lectures and reading materials helpful, and appreciated the professor's availability and use of diagrams to explain concepts. However, others felt that the professor lacked experience and was often imprecise in her explanations. They suggested that she could improve her teaching by moving slower through key topics, being more precise with wording, and focusing more on the concepts that would be tested in the exams.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course varied according to the students' backgrounds and experiences. Some students with prior experience in finance or economics found the course relatively easy or medium in difficulty. However, others without such background found the course somewhat difficult or hard. Despite the challenges, some students felt confident in their understanding of finance after taking the course.

They particularly enjoyed the projects at the end of the class, although some wished for more guidelines on what was expected of them. However, some students found the course more difficult than expected, especially when the professor referenced content from an assumed prior class, Investments, which required them to spend extra time going over that content.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the feedback was mixed. Some students found the class challenging and required effort to fully understand the content, especially for those who had not recruited for finance yet. Others found the workload manageable and appreciated the guest speakers and the project, which they found fun and informative. However, some students felt that too much time was spent on company evaluation presentations, from which they did not learn much.",
      "Teaching Style": "Regarding the teaching style, the professor was generally well-received. Students found him to be laid back, kind, and approachable. They appreciated his willingness to answer questions and the practice problems they went through in class. However, some students felt that he was not the best lecturer as he tended to just read off slides. They suggested that he could improve by going over harder examples that mimic what they saw on problem sets and exams, explaining the answers to questions in the slides a bit more, and going more in-depth with the problem examples.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course was perceived differently among students. Some found it more difficult than expected, especially those who were first-time learners of corporate finance or only had a financial accounting background. They felt that students with prior knowledge or experience in finance performed better. On the other hand, some students did not find the course incredibly difficult relative to their background and experience. They suggested that having some sort of knowledge in finance or having done accounting before would be helpful, but not necessary, as the concepts could still be understood with a bit more time."

    "Summary": {
      "Grading": "The feedback on grading for the Competitive Strategy course was mixed. Some students found the grading guidelines unclear and felt that the standards for success were not well defined. They also mentioned that the feedback on their assignments was poorly written and did not help them understand why they lost points. However, some students appreciated the feedback provided by the TA on their assignments and did not find her grading too harsh. They also suggested that the TA could further engage with students via Canvas and make remarks regarding the various case-based assignments in class.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the course seems to be heavily based on case studies. Students found these case studies helpful in understanding competitive dynamics and improving their writing and understanding. However, some students felt that the lectures were not well incorporated into the course and that the professor simply went through the slides, which was sometimes boring. They also suggested that the professor could make the slides more succinct and post them in time for review before class. Some students also found the last hour of class, which was spent going over the slides, too rushed and not beneficial for understanding the topics covered.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the course was mainly based on discussions. Students found these discussions helpful in understanding the cases and bouncing ideas off one another. However, some students felt that the class was not very encouraging and that the discussions were too specific to each individual case. They also suggested that the professor could facilitate more creative discussions and thinking outside the box. Some students also felt that the professor failed to explain what he expected from students on weekly case study-based assignments and that his presentations failed to outline the key concepts needed to succeed in the course.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course was found to be reasonable by some students. They felt that the course was not difficult for non-econ majors and that several students outside of the major were able to succeed. However, some students found the course challenging for people with limited background but easy for people who have consulting/finance/business experience already. They also suggested that taking marketing management would help as the two courses are nearly identical."

The TA's were also praised for their helpful feedback and fair grading, although some students suggested that more reliable turnaround times for grading would be helpful.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, the course was described as having a perfect balance of work and learning. Students appreciated the interactive discussion format of the class, which expanded on assignment content. The written assignments were seen as particularly helpful in applying concepts learned in class and preparing for debates. However, some students found the weekly write-ups less useful. Overall, the workload was described as manageable and reasonable.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the course was highly praised. Professor Barry was commended for his ability to facilitate lively and open discussions, control tension during debates, and bring out key insights from readings. His engaging explanations of weekly readings and frameworks were also appreciated. However, some students suggested that more guidance on how to approach sensitive topics in discussions would be beneficial. The TA's were also praised for their responsiveness and helpful feedback.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course was generally seen as manageable. Students felt that the course was accessible to all backgrounds and did not require any specific prior knowledge. The course was described as helping to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills, but the content itself was not seen as difficult. However, some students noted that the assignments were graded fairly hard. Overall, the course was seen as engaging and doable for anyone willing to put in the work."

    "Summary": {
      "Grading": "The feedback on grading was generally positive, with students appreciating the problem sets and the learning they facilitated. However, some students suggested that the problem sets should be graded to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their understanding. There was also a suggestion to better link the lecture material with the problem sets, as some students felt that the problem sets focused more on foundational material that was somewhat overlooked in class.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, students acknowledged that the course was demanding and required a significant amount of time and effort. Despite this, they felt that they learned a lot from the course. The problem sets were particularly appreciated for their role in facilitating learning. However, some students felt that the lectures were a bit disjointed and could be better organized to make them more consistent and connected with the homework.",
      "Teaching Style": "Regarding the teaching style, students appreciated the professor's availability outside of class and his insights. However, they felt that the lectures were a bit hard to follow and didn't seem related to the problem sets. Some students suggested that the professor could use the chalkboard more often for technical/modeling concepts and work through some proofs line-by-line on the board. They also suggested that the professor could organize the lectures better, as they often covered multiple slide decks every day.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The course was considered challenging by the students, with some finding the lectures hard to follow. However, they appreciated the professor's clear lecturing style and the opportunity to go over papers in class. The problem sets were considered the best part of the course, contributing most to their learning. The students felt respected and valued in the course, with many finding it easy to participate and ask questions. They also appreciated the engaging class discussions and felt that their participation was valued. The TA, Josh Higbee, was highly praised for his helpfulness, accessibility, and the quality of his problem sets and slides."

This was seen as beneficial as it provided a wide range of useful knowledge. The teaching assistant, Runxin Ni, was also praised for her kindness and helpfulness, setting a high standard for other TAs.",
      "Workload": "In terms of workload, some students felt that the lectures were not engaging enough and that some of the material felt dry. They suggested that more emphasis could be placed on the actual optimization algorithms rather than on convexity as a mathematical concept. There was also a suggestion for a better classroom environment to keep students more alert and less likely to feel sleepy.",
      "Teaching Style": "The teaching style was generally well-received, with students finding the lecture speed comfortable. However, there were concerns about the instructor's approach to teaching, particularly the reliance on reading from slides. This was seen as less engaging and potentially contributing to a lack of interest in the material. There was also feedback about the TA's willingness to answer questions when there were multiple students in the office hours.",
      "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course was not directly addressed in the feedback. However, the suggestion to focus more on optimization algorithms and less on mathematical concepts may indicate that some students found the theoretical aspects of the course challenging.
