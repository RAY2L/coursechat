He never updated the Canvas syllabus, rarely had lectures and ipnyb files uploaded before students reminded him, always put homeworks up late (we were supposed to have one homework per week, but since he was so behind on teaching, we had to delay several homeworks). Trimble would come to class entirely unprepared, not having rehearsed what he was going to teach us. His lectures were all over the place with no through line, and I deeply hope that he reads this course evaluation and thinks to put a little bit more effort into this class.
