In addition, lecture notes were never published and so if you missed a day, you were out of luck. I found myself relying heavily on the textbook for this reason.

The lectures also helped give me a deeper understanding of the history.", "The essays really helped broaden my understanding of the primary texts, and the final forced me to really learned about important concepts.", "The lectures were not as helpful as they could have been.

The only way to get this information was to go to lectures, but Professor Pomeranz was overall not a very good lecturer so it was hard to take cohesive notes."], "Additional comments about the course:": ["I would prefer the previous class structure", "The lectures were ordered in a way that I wasn't a huge fan of. The presentation slides had little to no information on it, and the professor would just verbally talk for most of it. This led to you having to take rapid notes which if you missed any of what he said you couldn't reference anywhere else for that information.", "Setting aside the lecturer's capabilities, the structure of the class was not done well. It was hard to keep all of the facts and timelines in order as the time periods and countries we covered jumped around constantly. The class should go back to the previous structure where it was divided by countries because dividing by time period is too much incohesive information all at once."], "Thinking about your time in the class, what aspect of the instructor's teaching contributed most to your learning?": ["W\u00e1ng was very knowledgeable and framed each document well within the course as a whole. Additionally, she consistently challenged us to look deeper at the writer's motives and how the document fits into our modern preconceptions (oftentimes it refuted them).

The power pint has totally no relationship with the class content", "More detailed lecture outlines would be greatly beneficial, as they are mostly bullet points with the topics discussed rather than any details on them.", "I think that the class is fantastic and her teaching is great!", "More information on the powerpoints that corresponds to what he's saying would be very helpful. Our section leader did publish outlines of lectures, but they were very vague and broad and did not really help if I truly missed something he said.", "The lecture slides could be improved or the lecture notes provided after the class could be way more helpful. I think he refused to upload his notes in an effort to force people to come to class but his lectures were never very clear and jumped around between subjects so taking notes was difficult.

At the beginning of the quarter, the discussions were not as helpful as they could have been. The small group discussions were helpful in understanding the materials on a base level. In my personal opinion the class engagement was not a fair reflection of the work we put into the class. At times it felt like the professor and TA's did think this was our only class and the only class we had to prepare for so that was very frustrating at times. But halfway through the quarter Wang You did ask for feedback on how we felt the quarter was going and did make some adjustments where she could to help us out.

From the title and course description, it is obvious that students will gain a sense of understanding how the publication process works on a basic level. I think one of the most important skills that I gained surrounded how to read closely and quickly. One would think that reading a book or manuscript of poetry would take limited time. I argue that this is not true. This course builds up that skill. Additionally, I learned how to familiarize myself with the way in which other people read poetry. Week after week I gained a better understanding of how my classmates absorbed poetry and what they liked and disliked. Lastly, I learned how to be simultaneously respectful and critical of work \u2014 when to say a definite \"yes\" and \"no.\" This skill can be challenging when faced with many options and opinions.", "I learned about how to review and assess poetry manuscripts.

Because these readings are all real submissions for publication, the work is practical. This was an effective method to gain insight into publishing and to learn how to critically assess books as a group\u2014especially important for an industry that is highly collaborative.", "Beginning the course by reading poetry and getting a feel for the Phoenix Poets series was a great introduction before diving into the manuscripts submitted to the UC Press. The reader's reports we submitted each week once we started reading manuscripts helped me synthesize my thoughts and made our editorial meetings run smoothly.", "Listening to Chicu talk with his expertise in contemporary poetry and publishing was honestly the best part of this course. The discussions in groups, reading of published works as well as the manuscripts, and full class discussions were also essential to my learning. Reading poetry by the editors of the Phoenix Press currently was really really helpful in setting the stage for how to come up with what I was looking for during the quarter.", "The most crucial feature of the course was reading the manuscript submissions to the UChicago Press' Phoenix Poets series. All of the work is unpublished, and it was thrilling and excruciatingly painful to read so much poetry, and so much bad poetry. This is the meat of the course. The meetings with poets and with the Press were not nearly as useful as I wanted them to be, unfortunately, though reading the consulting editors' books was useful.", "The first three weeks were devoted to understanding the audience and aims of the series, which was productive and essential for the work of the later weeks, where lectures/structure were far less.", "speaking with authors was extremely interesting.", "The long discussion periods we got with our editorial teams were really useful and interesting as we got to hear everyone's thoughts. The first few weeks where we read already published works also gave us a solid foundation for what to expect and how to evaluate poetry.", "The weekly discussions were really fun. For the latter half of the quarter, we were broken into editorial teams and we got to forward one manuscript out of the pool of manuscripts we were assigned to read. I made great connections with my peers and have learned how to read poetry in different ways.", "This course was broken up into two parts. The first surrounding the publication process itself. The second being time spent with an in\u2013class editorial group.\n\nFor the first part of the course I believe that the field trips, in class exercises, and zoom calls allowed me to understand the past and present of the Phoenix Press. I think pushing this envelope a little bit more would be fruitful. This could be having students read a past book of poetry published by the press of their choosing. Or establishing editorial groups early on and allowing them to read the same book from the press' previous publications.\n\nFor the second part of the course, I enjoyed being able to understand the ways that others thought about the course and the manuscripts they were reading. It kept discussion interesting and created a revolving door of information amongst students.", "I think the weekly editorial team meetings in class are really helpful for me to discuss and hear what my classmates think about the manuscripts we read.", "Editorial reports & group discussions allowed us to fine\u2013tune our evaluation skills & hash out ideas.", "The hyper\u2013exposure to poetry and class discussions were always insightful and fascinating.", "We visited and heard from multiple writers and editors which gave a deep insight into how poetry gets produced today. We read over 60 poetry manuscripts submitted to Phoenix Poets, a great overview of the kind of things being written right now. In class, we discussed these books and collaboratively chose one, giving us the experience of an editorial group at a press."], "Additional comments about the course:": ["Chicu's great!", "Chicu is a passionate, compelling speaker, who was constantly open to student feedback. He listened to our suggestions and made sure 1) the work was actually helping us learn and 2) that the work didn't overburden us. I couldn't recommend this course highly enough.", "I feel really lucky to have been able to take this class\u2014to have an English class that both feels and is so current with a professor who values each of our opinions so deeply was just an incredible opportunity.", "I adored this course: I gained practical, applicable skills for the industries I am interested in, without this feeling purely career\u2013oriented. It was the most productive cross possible between a literature course and an internship. I would have loved to have had this course earlier in my college career, and hope there are more like it in the future!", "Very enjoyable and unique course. A lot of work in terms of reading, but a once\u2013in\u2013a\u2013lifetime learning experience, definitely worth it if you are willing to make that commitment."], "Thinking about your time in the class, what aspect of the instructor's teaching contributed most to your learning?": ["Discussions on the form, content, meaning\u2013making in contemporary poetry helped me the most.", "I enjoyed hearing how he read works and judged them. He helped me understand the various aspects that can make a manuscript successful.", "Chicu allowed us to speak for most of the class, only offering his comments at the beginning and end. This made the course feel student\u2013driven and allowed me to tailor my work to address my own weakness in reading and evaluating poetry.", "The instructor generated a very welcoming setting in which to discuss out thoughts about what we read and was clear about the expectations for assignments.", "Chicu asked questions and allowed our own thoughts to build/influence his. His flexibility and thoughtfulness was honestly unmatched to other professors I've had here, and it made me want to excel in the class. He encouraged us to form our own opinions and methods of evaluation, constantly doing this to help us trust ourselves while also giving us important background in what's going on in the publishing world now.", "Chicu contributed the most when he was offering us strategies of how to read so much poetry, and what the goals of the series are, and what the goals of literary publishing are. I also appreciated hearing what his picks were after each week and think that should be kept for the next iteration of the course\u2013\u2013sometimes because his picks were totally outrageous.", "the few times we went over specific poems as a group, and questions chicu posed the other authors, and his reflections about metaquestions on publishing and art generally were most interesting. as were specific titillating bits of poetry\u2013world gossip/scandals/hoaxes that have raised those theoretical questions.", "Chicu is really committed to open communication and making sure that the scope of the content wasn't too overwhelming for us. He's also generous with feedback on our performance so that we feel comfortable and secure about how we're doing in class.", "Chicu is an amazing instructor. He was very attentive to everyone's feedback and made the class an enjoyable, comfortable experience. Every class he would ask us how we felt about the workload and paid mind to the fact that we were all knew to this level and caliber of reading.", "I really appreciated Chicu's interests and contribution to the ways we thought about publications. Chicu's explanations about what publication has looked like in the past and present helped when approaching the course manuscripts.", "\"Mini lectures\" on the process of poetry publication & insight in manuscript discussions were helpful.", "The professor did an amazing job at creating an environment for open\u2013minded, respectful discussion.", "Chicu was a fantastic instructor. Apart from designing and creating this incredible course in the first place, he gave very interesting insights into the publishing world, and facilitated fascinating discussions on what different people are drawn to in poetry. He taught us how to defend our opinions while also teaching us to listen to and learn from each other's differing ones. He was deeply engaged in what we had to say, taking our opinions into account into his own preliminary selections for the prize."], "What could the instructor modify to help you learn more?": ["NA", "I think I would appreciate more theory and guidance at the beginning of the course. MOre reading theory on why we like works or how to connect and analyze poetry would guide the process a bit more.", "Every week, each editorial team would present their findings to the class. Because each team was assigned different manuscripts, these discussions felt somewhat unproductive. If this class were offered again, I'd prefer it if we all read the same manuscripts, even if that means we don't get to read all (or even most) of the submissions to the contest. The collaboration is what made this class special and the editorial teams felt so generative because we were all approaching them having completed the same readings.", "Nothing.", "Even giving more of his own opinion and experience could be helpful, I think.", "I was sometimes frustrated by how much time we spent talking about the process of the course. Granted, a lot of the course requires figuring out a process, but even early on, I felt like Chicu spent too much time talking about the process and pedagogy, and not enough time actually talking about poetry. I would've loved to spend more time doing more traditional literary analysis (or even critical judgment) of Sho, Life in a Field, MyOther Tongue, Vexations, and The Orange Tree, because I think we could've built up a stronger community of critics (and a sense of everyone else's critical inclinations!) before we launched into reading submissions.", "There was a definite lack of predictability and structure in the later weeks (natural for such a new, different course), but communication was regular and clear, and so there was a lot of sorting\u2013out and reorganizing in class, it was never an obstacle to learning or participation.", "the first part of this course is structured as an introduction to the phoenix poets' book series, contemporary publishing generally, and a warm up to reading in volume. we should spend more of that time \u2013 and there was rather a lot of it; it felt pretty loose at times \u2013 doing more traditional close reads of poems, so that we have some foundation before going into to speed\u2013round reading. i felt a little disappointed to be in the room with such a deeply read and successful poet and not get more of his insight on the fine\u2013scale work of poems.", "Perhaps change up the way editorial teams are formed or the manuscripts are distributed? Not really for the sake of learning more but simply because I think it'd add some interesting elements into the course.", "This was the first time the class was offered, and he did a pretty good job of being flexible so there's not much he could have done.", "I think there could be more ways to connect the two aspects of the course. I touched on this a bit earlier in the course feedback.", "I hope the professor could join more of our discussions on selecting manuscripts each week since we usually spent most of the class time only discussing with other students in our editorial group. I think it would also be helpful if the professor could give more lectures on how to review and evaluate poetry manuscripts.", "n/a", "I would have loved to see Chicu's comments on the manuscripts! I think there is much to learn from the difference between our opinions and his, due to our differences in age, level of exposure to poetry, and professional experience."], "Other course elements not mentioned above:": ["Zooms with accomplished poets.", "by \"laboratory experience\" i mean zoom meetings w authors", "We were able to talk to the authors of future publications at the press. This was really exciting.", "Zoom visits from writers and editors \u2013 very cool and insightful"], "Please comment on the level of difficulty of the course relative to your background and experience.": ["Everything was made manageable and helped me build my knowledge", "The course is challenging, but accessible. I came into it feeling shaky about my poetry evaluation skills and Chicu understood that, taking the time to establish a critical foundation before we began our practical work with manuscript submissions.", "The course has a heavy reading load, but the professor made sure to offset that with less writing assignments. I did not consider myself very knowledgeable about poetry before taking this class, but still found it to be very accessible.", "This was a really good level of difficulty because you got out of the course what you put into it. I've taken English classes before, but not much poetry besides having a vague interest in poetry and contemporary publishing. Chicu designed this class to train our eyes the way we want\u2014it looks like a lot of reading, but by the time it hits you, you're prepared. And because it's a different kind of reading than normal, with an editorial eye, once you learn how to do that reading it goes by more quickly.", "Not difficult, just time consuming, but heartily enjoyable.", "No background or experience is needed, though a certain degree of comfort with reading and making judgements on poetry would probably be helpful in getting used to the demands of this course.", "If you have a background in poetry, prepare for your views on poetry to be changed.

I think the grading scale also feels quite subjective to the lector you are assigned to.", "One thing that stood out to me over the course of the quarter were the readers we were expected to write for. While I have adopted the process of writing for specific readers in all of my writing, and find this practice helpful, I do have one minor suggestion. Mainly, it seems that the course focuses on writing for challenging readers, and expert readers, often presenting these groups as synonymous. While I do believe that expert readers are often challenging, I would also suggest that lay readers and non\u2013expert readers are equally challenging. Creating a convincing and understanding argument for someone who does not typically read academic or argumentative writing provides its own, unique challenges. I suggest that one or more assignments over the course of the quarter may be positioned towards a non\u2013expert, or more general audience. I suggest this for two primary reasons. Firstly, this class focuses on Academic and Professional writing. As someone who submitted budget and project reports in my previous career, I would have to write reports for people who were in complimentary, if different, specialties, while also writing other reports who had no technical or expert knowledge in any similar discipline. Developing skills in writing for people who could not be construed as an \"expert\" in any field related to your work is a valuable and necessary skill for any competent professional. Secondly, in terms of the academic writers, with the decrease in tenure track jobs in most disciplines in academia, and the rise of adjunct or non\u2013tenured\u2013full\u2013time positions, successful scholars are needing to present their work in new and creative ways. Trade writing has become an essential component of modern scholarship, both for scholars to monetarily support themselves, and for, particularly humanities scholars, to keep their field relevant. The decline of university attendance will require an increased plea and advocacy from future and current professors, in order to see their work remain relevant and perhaps stymie the gushing life\u2013blood of rapidly expiring academic institution. Although perhaps this language appears like an overexageration, or hyperbolic, I do firmly believe that academia as we know it will irrevocably change or die in the coming decades, and that popular pleas for its relevance are a far more productive and potentially beneficial method of resuscitation than simple appeals to \"expert\" policy makers or administrators.", "Not a big fan of the paper handouts, as mentioned above.\n\nAssignment instructions and expectations were a bit unclear at the beginning of the quarter. Specifically, the weekly writing prompts do not provide rubrics, which made it unclear as to what the graders were specifically looking for.\n\nThe grading on the first 2 assignments was somewhat harsh, given the lack of clear grading expectations. My grades improved once I figured out what to focus on in each paper, but clearer expectations need to be established.", "There needs to be more oversight on the lectors who make up 50% of the course experience. To this date, I have not gotten a single grade or piece of feedback back from my lector. I did not know who to go to/ what to do about this. Our sections were cancelled multiple times, and always last minute, with no effective replacement instruction. There should be someone else from the writing program to stand in when this does happen. There also should be more oversight on what happens during sections. Overall I found mine to be a poor use of time. This then made me less engaged with the course in general and I was much less inclined to care about the lectures.", "Not much. Maybe just posting the writing assignments earlier for students who can't type a whole essay over the weekend due to other schedules.", "I liked Tracy's powerpoints.", "I think the last session was a little disorganized, and the concept of the warrant in the last few weeks was not integrated in a clear fashion into the rest of the lesson plan. The structure and the assignments themselves were excellent, however.", "I would have liked to have slides for all the weeks.", "A more cohesive curriculum between Kathy's and Tracey's lectures", "A better canvas page with programed assignments.", "It would be helpful to have a single handbook/slide deck at the end that covered all the lessons.

At times, she was borderline rude. For example, she made a disparaging joke about community college and with a student who asked a relevant question about how a theory would apply to Iran and Iran's president, she was very short with them and insisted that Iran had a shah, not a president, so they were wrong \u2013 that seems like relevant information for someone teaching the course to know.", "Was difficult to do all of the readings with all the other things going on in school \u2013perhaps needed a more precise list of topics etc", "The course is graded such that 20% of your grade is based on participation. 40% is based on a midterm, 40% is based on a final, and there was an extra credit assignment that could raise your grade 3%.

Unless you are prepared to spend an large amount of time outside of class working on this one, then this professor would be perfect for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere.", "This course was Gen Chem levels of confusing. The professor started with special relativity but did not explain where any of the equations came from, so any insight this might have given us was useless. In general, instead of learning techniques to solve problems of broad scope, everyone just memorized how to solve the specific problems he discussed in class. Since the quizzes and exams are just problems pulled from the p sets, this works fine, but I didn't actually learn how to apply anything from the class to any other problems. He used lots of math which most of the class didn't know (linear algebra, multi) and proceeded to explain it in the most confusing way possible. The textbook was okay, but it was riddled with typos and sequiturs. Apparently he'd just wrote it last summer and he asked us to check it for him.", "Henry is a great professor who genuinely cares about his students like no other professors would at this university. He listed the criteria to succeed in his class from day one.", "Good but hard. I really like Professor Frisch.", "Please only take this course with Frisch if you have some background knowledge in physics and calculus. A lot of material such as polar coordinates, integration, partial derivatives, differential equations, were assumed as pre\u2013requisite knowledge for this course.", "tuesday night discussions are virtual, which is nice! though they aren't really necessary?", "You'll get an A if you do the psets and go to class", "To Administration:\n\nThe poor structuring of the quarter, beginning on a Wednesday, ending on a Monday, and taking a weeklong break in the middle, made certain material extraordinarily intense as it was forced to be rushed. If the quarter had been planned better, then I feel like I would've gotten a lot more out of this course. The additional requirement for the final to be ridiculously early in the morning has also added a lot of stress to the review of the material, making the rushed topics feel even more stressful. Please, consider the toll exacted upon the students by these scheduling issues. Have a great day!", "The instructor is a cool dude. He gives out his landline (which his wife occasionally answers) and ignores the administration when they tell him to change his class. The course is not too hard, but if you are very interested I would say this is a great course too.", "This course was great for understanding the material in depth and with a valuable perspective, which was useful for me as physics is relevant for my future plans.

As a prospective physics major I felt like the professor introduced me to important physics and math concepts (more on par with honors physics) that other physics 131 classes were not getting. The math and concepts seem intimidating but the professor actually simplifies it very much so we end up avoiding most of the complex math. Overall it was a good introduction to higher level physics. That being said, if you are not interested in physics I do not recommend this course because there is a fair amount of self\u2013teaching and confusion involved and if you are not motivated to learn these more esoteric concepts and are looking for a basic physics class, you will not enjoy this class.", "I found that the grading of the questions was very inconsistent from the TAs, and some of their advice on the questions and their posted solutions to the problem sets to be unhelpful and lacking at times.", "Course was sloppily arranged. Textbook was confusing and filled with typos, and lectures were often repetitive and meandering. Labs rarely connected with what was covered in class.", "Professor Frisch required a significant level of math background (much higher than is expected for 131 students). Although he tried to teach us some math along the way, he never fully explained the math. So, it felt as though you needed to be familiar with simple linear algebra and vector calculus before taking his course.", "This course is geared towards building an intuitive understanding of physics and an understanding of the physics notation real physicists use, which is interesting, but not necessary for everyone taking a regular physics class. This kind of material would be better geared for an honors class.", "I expect Frisch to receive a large amount of negative feedback. I think a lot of this comes from a difference in expectations. I (and a lot of others) expected this course to be like AP physics. Instead we walked through physics with heavy emphasis on learning the correct mathematical notation to describe everything. This includes the Lorentz transformations for special relativity, computing the correct vectors and cross products to describe rotations, using the Taylor expansion to get simple Harmonic motion at the bottom of a potential well, etc etc. A MUCH MORE INTERESTING discussion of physics than AP physics. Sometimes my friends and I found it frustrating to have to learn actual material in a \"first year class\". But I think the course is graded fairly easily, and the stuff I learned was definitely worthwhile.", "This was a hard course content\u2013wise but the office hours are helpful and the professor sets clear expectations on what will be on assessments.

He is certainly willing and excited to teach, but has been a physicist for so long that it is difficult for him to understand what it is like to be introduced to these topics. As a result he approaches the concepts with 'hand wavey' mathematic explanations which are honestly just insufficient to explain concepts like angular motion for the first time. In addition, he chose to rearrange the course material, which meant that I spent about a 5th of the quarter on special relativity, which while interesting, is not explicitly helpful for my future learning, and have not learned concepts taught in other courses like fluidity, density, hydrostatic forces.", "In this course you really need to work collaboratively and also dedicate a lot of time to working on assignments."], "Thinking about your time in the class, what aspect of the instructor's teaching contributed most to your learning?": ["Good at chalkboard", "Frish's lectures did help me understand the content, although it takes a while to chew on the content.", "His honesty and readiness to help his students", "The \"finite set of problems\" which we worked to death in lecture until everyone in the room knew how to do them with our eyes closed.

He would have unclear notation, and explain very abstract concepts unclearly, which is extremely annoying and odd considering that this is the intro course, where you are expected to have no prior knowledge.

Some students expressed frustration about the delay in receiving feedback on their homework, which made it difficult for them to understand the expectations for the assignments.

Some students suggested that providing an answer sheet for the homework, without the solution, would be a helpful way for them to gauge their understanding and know whether they were doing the problems correctly.", "Workload": "In terms of workload, students found the course to be challenging. They noted that the labs required a significant weekly time commitment, but did not contribute to their learning. The labs often involved analyzing equations and properties of systems that had not yet been covered in class, which left many students feeling confused. They felt that the labs felt more like busy work than a learning experience. Some students also suggested that the instructor could assign additional practice problems to help them gauge their understanding of the topics covered in class.", "Teaching Style": "The teaching style of the instructor received mixed reviews. Some students appreciated the instructor's use of demonstrations with real objects and problem solving on the board. They found his lectures entertaining and his explanations clear and easy to follow. However, other students felt that the instructor rushed through material and did not provide enough examples. They also noted that the instructor was frequently late to lectures and did not provide enough assistance outside of class. Some students suggested that the instructor could improve his teaching by answering questions more clearly, providing more worked through examples in class, and better managing his time.", "Difficulty Level": "The level of difficulty of the course varied depending on the students' background and experience. Some students who had taken AP Physics in high school did not find the course particularly challenging, while others who had no previous experience in physics found the course very difficult. Some students felt that the course could have progressed more quickly, while others wished that the course had incorporated higher level mathematics. Some students suggested that the instructor could modify the labs to make them easier to understand and more closely aligned with lectures, tests, and homework."}}, "cbed73186850523dc2676b904d140a7ed078fa705179c8d9dd63e8206bbf99fdb74312c8b86b9b763e9519df4a44ac02": {"Id": "cbed73186850523dc2676b904d140a7ed078fa705179c8d9dd63e8206bbf99fdb74312c8b86b9b763e9519df4a44ac02", "Report Title": "PHYS 13100 3 - Mechanics - Instructor(s): Savan Kharel", "Catalog Number": [{"Subject": "PHYS", "CourseId": "13100", "Section": "3"}], "Course Name": "Mechanics", "Instructors": ["Savan Kharel"], "Academic Year": "Autumn", "Academic Term": "2022", "Number Enrolled": "145", "Number Responses": "79", "Evaluation Text Data": {"What are the most important things that you learned in this course?

Boller's board work is probably the best I have ever seen, super neat handwriting and he never cluttered the boards. Only complaint about lectures is that a couple of times Boller wrote down definitions incorrectly, and this caused a lot of confusion.\n\nHomework: One problem set of roughly 10 required problems per week. Most of the problems were quite good for practicing the theory laid out in the lectures. About half the problems are working out certain examples, and then the other half are proving some fairly simple theorems. The only complaint is that there were a number of problems, particularly about constructing explicit embeddings (of the Klein Bottle in R^4 for example), that were overly difficult. Pretty much nobody could figure these out, and Boller was not helpful at all in office hours with these. I even have the suspicion that Boller does not really know how to do these himself.\n\nOffice hours: Not especially helpful, but fine overall. Boller constantly had to change the office hours schedule, but I understand because he's so busy.", "Lectures were well\u2013organized; Boller follows the book (Munkres) closely. Assignments were fair in length and difficulty and provided a number of optional problems which helped in preparing for the midterms.", "The lectures were the most helpful. The conceptual pictures and examples especially.", "Lectures were mostly fine, but Prof. Boller would (not all the time, but frequently enough) make mistakes on the board when giving a definition, stating a theorem, or giving a proof. And these mistakes were nontrivial; for example, we used an incorrect definition of locally compact for two lectures, and other times we missed conditions while trying to prove a theorem. The mistakes really detracted from lectures because I had to always cross check what he wrote on the board with Munkres. Other than that, Prof. Boller is a good lecturer: he moves at a good pace, gives us intuitive examples, and engages with the class.\n\nProblem sets were MAINLY good, but after we learned the quotient topology, Prof. Boller started giving us problems that were objectively way beyond what we did in class and didn't give us the resources to solve them. For example, writing an explicit embedding of the Klein bottle in R^4. Also, I swear he gave us a problem that is literally an open question in mathematics.\n\nFinally, I would say office hours were generally unhelpful; it often seemed like Prof. Boller didn't actually know the answers to the difficult problems on our problem sets. Otherwise, exams were quite well\u2013written and Prof. Boller is extremely approachable and passionate about topology.", "Lectures contributed to learning. He is great at presenting what he knows. In addition, he provides several examples that are really useful to enhancing your understanding. His diagrams are great, and he tries to make sure that everyone is participating/understanding of what is going on. Unfortunately, Boller made mistakes pretty frequently. When he did not make mistakes, his lectures were great. However, the moment he said something wrong, class would often be derailed as these would be related to concepts critical to our understanding (e.g., the wrong definition for the basis of a topology). Often, I had to reference Munkres to clear any mistakes made, but it was sometimes hard to compare what he said in class to Munkres, and I wish he had followed the textbook more closely. I think if Boller was more careful in presenting, lectures would be much better.\n\nI think HW assignments had a mix of problems. Most were good, but several involved intense function definitions (relating to the quotient topology) that did not improve my understanding of the course material. Instead, they made me more stressed to finish, spending several hours on one problem.", "The lectures were quite useful in understanding the concepts, and the assignments were pretty thorough in covering all material in the class and occasionally even introducing different ideas not completely explored in class.", "Lectures and homework", "Assignments were a bit longer than I would expect from an elective and some were pretty tedious, others were helpful for learning."], "Additional comments about the course:": ["Grading scheme: 20% homework, 20% midterm 1, 20% midterm 2, 40% final exam to come.\n\nBoth midterms were well written fair exams.", "I think it would be beneficial for assignments to be graded faster.
