        "The specific effects that AI and algorithms have on our rights.",
        "I believe the most important thing I learned in this course is that new technologies should not only be decided upon by its creators. While we should listen to experts, this does not mean we cannot have our own opinions on AI and algorithms.",
        "Algorithms rely on human control",
        "Learned about basis of STS, capitalism & technology, surveillance, philosophical concepts like hermeneutics, democracy, tech stuff"

      "Describe how aspects of this course (lectures, discussions, labs, assignments, etc.) contributed to your learning.": [
        "Lectures and readings were very important and necessary to apply human rights\u2013based understanding to topics not covered in the lecture. Our final paper was showing what we learned and how we can apply it. Lastly, discussion posts encouraged outside research and keeping up to data with the quickly changing field.",
        "The lectures/discussions were super interesting. I really like that we could choose our own topic for the assignments so I could really learn how applicable this class was to things that I'm interested in",
        "The lectures were very thought\u2013provoking and detailed.",
        "I enjoyed every lecture! Before class we would be assigned some readings. I've never had a course for which I enjoyed all of the readings. Each class was set up well by the assigned readings.",
        "Some of the classes were lectures, while others were more discussion\u2013based. I liked the mix.",
        "Readings were (personally) not very helpful, but lectures and discussions were always interesting and often the primary way I was learning the material in this class. The project was also helpful, especially with the way the instructor split it up into parts over the course of the quarter."

        "Austin is a great professor!",
        "Due to my own concerns and questions, I've been looking to take a course that falls within the intersection of modern tech and legal studies. This course exceeded my expectations and left me with more questions! I hope to take more courses like this one",
        "Wonderful course idea and execution. Should be required for computer science, data science, human rights people.",
        "I think the reading should be cut down. I know it's supposed to be a grad\u2013level amount of reading, but it's also a great way to guarantee that students won't actually do it. Oftentimes, I felt like a text could have been reduced to two or three slides in a lecture instead of having us read 70 pages."

        "I very much enjoyed all of the lectures! I've never had a professor before convince me that a reading I had found boring or difficult to be interesting! Our professor was clearly passionate and knowledgeable about the topic",
        "Austin is super knowledgeable and passionate and an interdisciplinary thinker. He is also great at making people who don't know a lot about tech feel comfortable about voicing their opinions.",
        "The lectures were interesting, especially when he demonstrated different ways we could think about an issue. He is clearly very knowledgeable and wants to share a lot of material about law and human rights with us. He did a mid\u2013quarter survey and definitely implemented the feedback he got from it."
      ],
      "What could the instructor modify to help you learn more?": [
        "Sometimes there were very large amounts of reading that were hard to read in\u2013depth and if there were fewer readings I could have understood them each more.",
        "Assign less reading/cut down reading to more specific topics. A lot of the reading was so much that it was overwhelming and I would get lost.",
        "Nothing!",
        "Nothing! The one thing would be that the lecture styled classroom was set up in a way that was not useful for the desired discussions, so a classroom change would improve the course",
        "More discussions. Also class setup was not conducive to paying attention or discussion (awful classroom tbh)",
        "I think there should be less reading and I also think the thru\u2013line of the course could be a little more clear. However, with a couple of modifications, I think this could be a great course. This is also a very small thing, but I wish he would have made an effort to learn our names. It's a small enough class that I find it a little strange that he didn't."

The midterm project, while time\u2013consuming and challenging, was an especially good opportunity because we had the chance to use a very large data set and write a whole self\u2013directed 4\u2013page report on it. It was very open ended, but I believe it contributed to my growth as a data scientist.",
        "Lectures were really fun and interactive, with our teacher being very easy to speak to and learn from. Her slides were clear and having our own code running at the same time made it much easier to digest and understand.\nLab sessions were very helpful for applying concepts from class by oneself with support from TAs.",
        "Slides and notebooks were extremely helpful. Labs are not necessary but they are good additional practice.",
        "The lectures were not good, specially when we started learning statistics (from week 5 till the end of the course), the lectures were very vague and unclear. The lab was useful, until they turned the lab into an assignment that you must do to get extra credit in your homework, not to mention that the homework assignments were really tough and lacked any instructions, you may spend a whole day or two just trying to figure the assignment out and search for ways to solve it if you don't have any prior knowledge in coding and statistics.",
        "lectures were helpful, homework wasn't always, labs were not at all",
        "The labs especially were an excellent way to enhance my learning outside of the lectures, though the lectures were obviously the main source of learning for the material. This course is somewhat self\u2013taught, which I appreciate.",
        "homeworks and labs were helpful, lecture was poorly designed and difficult to follow, seemed to be thrown together last minute and the instructor didn't really understand the code or the stats half the time",

        "Lectures covered the basics and labs were most similar to the homework assignments.",
        "Assignments were needlessly ambiguous. Homeworks were riddled with typos that often resulted in lost points (likely because content was recycled from previous quarters, and no effort was made to proofread them). The grading policy was also unclear; rubric items magically appeared on Gradescope midway through the quarter\u2014after grades were returned. (\u201cYou didn\u2019t run the Jupyter cell to show an output. Even though all of your work is visible, and even though your answer is correct, and even though we didn\u2019t tell you this was a rubric item, you\u2019re losing points. This is a totally accurate and reasonable metric of your learning :).\u201d)\n\nLabs were useless. TAs were often confused themselves and gave advice that contradicted the instructors. That said, I actually think they\u2019d do a better job of running the course. Make of that what you will."

      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "Professor Lange was great! On top of being a generally knowledgeable and friendly person, she was also very available for questions and was precise with her responses. All else equal, learning that Dr. Lange was teaching a class would make me more likely to take that class.",
        "The course is very good but I feel like the pre\u2013requirements should have been listed or at least the lectures could thoroughly go over some topics before diving into how python can be used to extract data from the topics.",
        "The course covers a wide ranger of concepts in a short time, but does not dive deep into them.",
        "Very challenging class, and very poorly designed in terms of assignments and lectures, this should be an intro class for those who don't have any experience in data science, yet if you don't have any experience you will most probably face A LOT of trouble handling this course.",
        "The assignments were graded and returned way to late to understand and learn from prior mistakes. This is problematic in a coding class, where skill build from prior skills. The lectures were pretty informative and engaging. I think they should make STAT220 a prerequisite because the ladder half of the course was exactly what I learned in stat2200 but just with python instead of R. This would give the class more time to learn about data science\u2013specific topics rather than just elementary statistics.",
        "The pace is so fast. The homeworks have things you've never seen before in class, and it was a struggle every week trying to figure out how to finish the pset.",
        "A useless course. Not computer science\u2013y enough to hone computer science skills, and not statistics\u2013y enough to hone meaningful stats skills. Perhaps this is a consequence of the field in general, which is a hodgepodge of various disciplines only made appealing by its use of marketable tech skills.\n\nThe instructors did a terrible job of administering the course. Course staff made little effort to respond to Ed posts in a timely manner, and when responses were posted, they were curt and/or unhelpful.\n\nThe difficulty was contrived. There was no reason for the grading policy to be as unforgiving as it was (I say this having taken proper CS courses, which are far more meaningful and, interestingly, more lenient). The content in itself isn\u2019t difficult. I mean, you\u2019ll be self\u2013studying AP stats for the latter half of the quarter, but that isn\u2019t *so* bad.\n\nThe one thing that I will take away from this course is that I am glad I am not majoring in DS. My expectations were low to begin with (having read the course evals before registering), but what I endured this quarter was beyond absurd. If you\u2019re minoring in DS like I am, I suppose it\u2019s worth suffering through. Find a study group. While sharing answers wasn\u2019t allowed, I suspect this wasn\u2019t enforced as well as it should have been (which, given the woeful standards of this course, wasn\u2019t surprising).\n\nThis course is in desperate need of revamping. Better yet, the DS department should be abolished altogether and absorbed into the CS department. Maybe then we\u2019d have a course that is commensurate with our inordinate tuition."

        "The course content is great. The class could be made sooo much better with one improvement: proofreading the homework assignments before they are released. I recognize going into CS/related courses that homework assignments can be vague sometimes and require clarification from the instructor. However,t this class took that to a whole new level. EVERY homework had numerous cases of vagueness or problems that were so frustrating for a student. Some of these felt like they would have been fixed with a quick review of the assignment and resulted in a student wasting hours to do questions that take minutes. Its a great course \u2013 with great Professors. I just wish they can improve on the clarity of the assignments even more because it can be very frustrating for students and leave a bad taste.",

Although I learned a good amount of the skills mentioned, the course mainly tests your ability to review the labs the night before the pset is due or just google which methods do whatever it is that you need to accomplish. It does not help you develop a computer\u2013like way of thinking you might develop alongside learning the capabilities of coding through learning about Python.

When going back into the posted slides I wish they were labeled based on topic so I could use them better in homework. All office hours sections were immensely helpful. Homework was helpful. Midterm project was helpful.",

It seemed that the way the class was set\u2013up was the professor using lecture to describe historical and practical examples of how coding/data analysis was used and to explain introductory statistics. I did not attend a single lab, but the labs supposedly helped develop a working library of methods and practice that was helpful in completing the psets.

        "I found the homework assignments to be fairly difficult given that it didn't really align with what was taught in class for that week. It took a lot of self\u2013learning for me to understand the concepts. I definitely recommend taking this class after having some basic coding experience.",
        "Intro to CompSci should become a pre requisite for this course",
        "This class is so unnecessarily hard for no reason?? Not because of the material but because of the professor. The professor just does not really teach? I barely understood any of the stat that was taught in this class because he did not really teach it in a coherent, learnable way. You just heard terms tossed here and there and no concrete method to implement anything?? I am just really confused by the professor because I feel like the stat taught in this class is not even that hard or advanced material\u2014he just did not teach it basically.",
        "The last three weeks of material are exponentially harder than the first few weeks. The professor goes on a lot of tangents and expects way too much statistical knowledge on the final exam. I wish better study resources and direction was implemented.",
        "As someone who took AP Comp Sci in high school and took Stat 234, there was very little to be learned and that is probably on me for signing up for the class. I intentionally took the class because I felt I could grasp the introductory classes quite simply. However, I believe that you can do little by doing too much too fast, and it seemed to me that the \"Python\" areas of the course were rushed over for the people with little (or no) coding experience while the statistics was rushed over for people with little (or no) statistics experience. I don't see a sample program for the data science major so I'm not sure where this class lines up in the course work timelines, but if this class is anywhere before the mathematical methods for data science class, it may be a good idea to have this class be taken later or change the material of the course to focus more on coding aspects or different sources of problem\u2013solving / data manipulation."

Attended Richard's final review session to go over general topics and the practice final and he had not even done the practice final so he was not very organized at going over the material and answering questions during that session. It was also way too small a room to be holding that review in, as many kids were seated on the floor or standing in the small conference room with many more attending through Zoom. I don't blame him though since it was the week before or of finals and everyone is really busy and stressed that week and stuff like that just slips by you.

        "I found the weekly homework assignments the most helpful aspect in my learning.",
        "The lectures in class were moderately helpful, although they were not always clear/covered the homework we were doing. The lab sections were really helpful.",
        "Posting the jupyter notebooks on Canvas for us to refer to outside of class was especially helpful.",
        "I'll be honest that the lectures weren't particularly helpful in doing our assignments. The professor often was late to teaching what we needed to know for assignments (would teach us the material that we needed to know for the pset on the day it was due while also encouraging us to start the assignment a week in advance).",
        "lecture and the notebooks were helpful",
        "Lectures were given in class, followed by office hours and homework on the material. The homework was most useful to learning material, as repeatedly trying to get to answers was the best way to learn.",
        "Lectures are absolutely useless. All my learning in this course was done by myself going through course materials on canvas and reading the textbook.",
        "Labs were personally helpful because it helped to practice material learned in class.",
        "the lectures werent important. i could just read the slides and be fine.",
        "labs and homeworks were pretty helpful",
        "assignments were challenging but doable forced me to learn how to code",
        "The notebooks we were given for reference were most useful for the p\u2013sets.",
        "Homeworks and in\u2013class assignments were most helpful.",
        "Labs\nThey were helpful in the beginning, because they provided the answers to them so we can use what we learned from the lab to help with the homework, but they removed the answers (as in one lab had only one answer out of 13\u201317 questions), because they wanted to count the complete lab as extra credit. There was no point in doing the lab if it was just as hard as the homework. It was poorly thought out and all teachers made a decision by week 3 or 4 on what to do with the labs and with the lab time. Ridiculous.",
        "Classes were helpful, sometimes not. But overall good lectures by professor Campbell who made an effort to get to know everyone.",
        "My own discovery and reading contributed the most. The class times did not have too much of an impact on my learning.",
        "Read additional info section",
        "Professor's lecture is completely useless, not even useful than the PowerPoint.",
        "The assignments were very poorly written. Super easy to tell that this is a newer class. Midterm and final exams did not fit the scope of the class and did not adequately reflect one's ability to code. Final exam was basically \"how well can you memorize syntax\" and they threw in a bunch of probability questions that weren't really covered in assignments. I don't usually fill out course recs, but felt a strong civic duty to inform people that this class sucked. Final exam should not be an exam \u2013\u2013 it should be a difficult coding project. Nobody cares how well you memorize things like memory allocation or how to merge dataframes \u2013\u2013 you can easily look it up on the job. I felt like I learned a lot, but was not tested on what was actually important in exams. Homeworks were super ambiguously written \u2013\u2013 same with midterm.",

Labs were also an integral part of the course \u2013 you are able to finish the homeworks without the help of the labs, but doing the labs are extremely helpful towards ocmpleting the homework.",

        "The lectures were extremely boring and generally did not contribute anything more than just going through the notebooks yourself. I found that collaborating with other students and working on the code on my own was more useful. However since it is a required course for the Data Science major, and it was not too difficult, I think it is a good option for anyone interested in learning some basic coding or is interested in the major.",
        "This class was good, but the lecture time was not as helpful as I thought it should've been. I learned more directly applicable material in lab sessions.",
        "I found that the class had an unbelievable amount of expected material to complete for an introductory course. The time alotted for labs were enough to finish one or two questions, let alone 15.",
        "I regret taking this course. Unless you know python beforehand or love coding, I would advice against taking this course. It moves incredibly fast second\u2013half, and if you are not going through the notes by yourself to make sure you're on top of everything, you will so easily fall behind.",
        "Often times class was not useful for doing well on the homework.",
        "At times it felt the professor was learning the content with us; she was helpful in explaining some concepts but in others learning was largely from class documents.",
        "Most of the learning was done independently through the completion of problem sets. The notebooks were helpful but when it came down to it most of the learning was independent",
        "Do not take this if you do not know any python already.",
        "read the next section",
        "Professor was clearly new to teaching. Expect to do a lot of self\u2013teaching with the textbook.",
        "It is hard to attend a class where the Professor does not seem to want to be there or when you don't feel encouraged to ask questions. I felt lectures could have been more helpful. Overall, not what I was expecting. Consider changing the final exam for a project or making it shorter.",
        "Honestly, more stats than Python. I had no coding background and hadn\u2019t taken stats prior to this course, so I found it challenging. Easier to teach yourself, to be honest.",
        "Taught CS in a way that's unintuitive and hard to understand had I not had previous CS experience. Taught stats in a way that's unintuitive and hard to understand, skims through a whole bunch of concepts while expecting us to understand each very well.",
        "Professor Campbell was great but I feel that the layout for the all of the new data science courses was flawed and unorganized.",
        "Professor Campbell is AMAZING. Great teacher and extremely passionate about teaching data science. I can tell that she genuinely cares about whether students are able to understand courses. Always very fair in terms of student expectations and always tries to make the classroom environment fun and conducive to learning. Highly, highly recommend.",
        "Please explain what slides instead of simply reading it during the lectures.",
        "Not really Dr. Campbell's fault, but the lectures were too short. There were too many topics to be covered in a 50 min class.",
        "Very difficult course. Lengthy assignments, harsh grading, and a crippling final.",
        "While I enjoyed this course, I have some ideas about how to improve it. I know that the Data Science department is relatively new, and so the Intro courses are still being developed/tested.\n1) I think it would be better to have an exam for the midterm, and a culminating project as the final, rather than the other way around. Overall, I feel like being given a real\u2013world data set, applying the skills learned in class directly to analyze it using code + statistics, and communicating your findings is much more in the spirit of the course and the field than an exam. Honestly, having a report as the midterm and a paper/presentation as the final seems like a good idea.\n2) I would change the extra credit received by the labs, or simply incorporate them into the homework (like having questions at the end that are worth extra credit), rather than having them be separate. I know that the way labs were graded changed partway through the course, and I agree with the changes made. However, sometimes it was hard to justify spending time doing a lab, when they were optional, were at most worth an extra 5%, and we could not turn in homework late. It seemed a better use of time to simply not do the lab and spend more time on the actual homework to get a better grade.\n3) Focus more on the statistics part of the course. While the programming aspects of the course were covered very extensively, I felt that towards the end, the stats got introduced and sort of glossed over. Because I did not have a strong stats background \u2013 I was taking calculus at the time \u2013 it was a lot harder to apply them in code. I would in the future dedicate at least one probability + hypothesis testing homework where programming takes more of a backseat, and instead focuses on the actual math behind the code."

        "Evelyn was good at setting an appropriate pace for the class as well as always stopping whenever she thought people were lost",
        "What contributed most to my learning was the in class exercises, which pushed us to realize if we understood the material more.",
        "Literally nothing. 90% of my learning was done by myself going through class notes and the other 10% was done during labs, where I would go if I had questions.",

        "The lecture notes pre\u2013written and the psets were all great, learned a lot from the. But Evelyn Campbell is the worst teacher/professor I have ever had in my entire life and second place is miles and miles away. She read every pre\u2013made presentation word for word and did not add a single piece of additional insight to it in 10 weeks. Not only did not she not know the first thing about data science, she was not even capable enough to bullshit her way into tricking me that she knew anything about it either. She legitimately would struggle trying to complete the second pset assigned to us. If you read her ED discussion responses to important questions students had about the psets you would witness cold hard evidence of her inability. She is apparently a PHD and wrote our textbook so this makes me entirely question the source of her lack of competence toward teaching data science. One time I asked her \"how do I know the process for selecting the right amount of bins for a histogram\" expecting a formula or a method to accomplish that and she responded with \"you just have to understand the process of the data\", so to test her I said \"oh ok so I just estimate a number\" which is obviously not what you are supposed to do, and she said \"yea you seem to get it\" and left. I overheard a student asking her how to use a for loop to accomplish the simple task of putting items into different lists and she fumbled over her words and tried to come up with a sensible response so hard to the point where I genuinely felt bad. For every student after me's sake and her own as well she needs to never ever teach a data science class again. People would ask her questions and she would legitimately respond by restating the question in a different format thinking she found her way out of answering. Not being a good teacher is one thing, not understanding the topic to its fullest extent is one thing, not knowing the topic well at all is one thing, but not knowing the topic well at all and not even having the wherewithal to be able to convince me that she knew the first thing about data science made me truly question why I spend so much money and time to go waste 50 of my minutes for something I could just be sent over email. She gave me a 73 on a midterm project that I later compared with students who received an 86 and a 95 and I had the exact same quality level of work if not better. I simply cannot comprehend how you can take off points on something you cannot even do yourself. I truly hope whatever research she is doing here is really, really, really, worth it because I would not subject her inability as a teacher to anyone who comes after me. I understand this is a new major to the college but I could take my 4 year old cousin and give him 24 hours to study the subject and he would likely be able to offer more additional insight than what is given in the slides than she did. I am trying to major in data science and this instructor makes me rethink if this is the right school to do that at if I am being entirely honest, and if this type of instruction continues I will relay that information to anyone and everyone who should hear it. She seems like a nice lady though.",

        "Actually, Professor Campbell could have used the notes less in class. She often read directly off of the powerpoint or jupyter notebook, so it was almost like self\u2013studying the class since she was giving us the information verbally in the lecture and physically through posting the notebook. Many people chose to just go over the notebook on their own and did not attend/pay attention to the lecture.",

I felt going to her office hours were about as helpful as talking to a wall, with her only advice being \"look it up\" \u2013\u2013 which isn't something we can do on the test. So actually explaining concepts would be more helpful. I received 50%\u201370% on the homeworks I went to her for, since she seemed pretty unable to explain how certain functions work together. I think we would have been benefitted by more class time, and explanations beyond \"this function does this\" and \"this hypothesis is about this\". Furthermore, nearly half the final wasn't related to what we had been learning all quarter. It seemed like the 1 week on stats took almost all of the final, with data science practices being minor pieces.\n\nWhat's more, I don't believe that Professor Campbell enjoyed the class, it seemed to be a slog for her. When I would go to office hours for help it almost seemed that she was actively trying to provide no help other than \"look up the answer\" waiting for me to leave. One time in class, she asked a question about how to solve a give a problem. No one answered, so I raised my hand to give a possible solution, which I prefaced with the fact that I wasn't sure. She responded with \"did you mean ...\" and proceeded to give a very complex sounding solution. I said that her solution wasn't what I was thinking but sounded better. She scoffed and reprimanded me for not being clearer with my solution. If Professor Campbell seemed to actually have a mastery of the subject then it was normal, but her lack of expertise made it seem rude.",

This led to a lot of us wondering whether or not our teacher knew what they were doing, and relying on other teachers from different sections to teach us. Learn how to explain topics better and answer the students questions without causing more confusion. When people ask questions that are somewhat off topic these questions should be answered during OH bc it takes up class time, if what they asked was important then tell us in the next class.",

The office hours were meant to double as the lab section, but the labs were so long and confusing, that I never made it through the second question.

He gave us shortcuts in how to do certain problems and he was present in TA sessions that were not run by him. I'm not sure if he is the \"lead\" TA or whether or not that's this job (to be present at TA sessions not lead by him), but it was very thoughtful and he always contributed and tried to help. He genuinely put more effort than the 4/6? TAs that I've met. I genuinely believe that he is one of the main reasons as to why more students didn't fail the class, and he stayed after his office hours often. If he thought that many students had a question on a particularly hard problem he would teach all (30\u201350) kids in his office hours (he would make an announcement about what problem he's going to teach and tell us all to watch if we want to) on the whiteboard and tell us to make sure we understand and ask questions as he goes.

I am sincerely grateful for having Richard as our TA in the past two quarters, and I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.",

        "Again, the lack of coding experience still makes things difficult sometimes. This quarter the topics also became much much more complex, and the theory behind why the concepts work could do with more explanations sometimes.",
        "I took Intro Data Science 1 last quarter and previously took CS 151 (the old intro course with racket). I've also taken STAT 234. I was definitely prepared for the class, and think that even with only the prerequisite Intro Data Science 1 course you can succeed.",

        "As someone who had never coded before Data 118, the Python and SQL parts of the class weren't hard to follow. However, having a background/interest in stats would probably be useful for conceptually understanding the topics of the course.",
        "This course built off of the foundation of DATA 118. I felt that it was slightly easier, especially the homework assignments. The course covers a lot of ground very quickly and gives more of an overview of a bunch of concepts than a deep dive, so it was very doable as an introductory level class.",

        "A LOT harder than 118, not gonna lie",

        "I never went to class, so it was hard. It is easy to teach yourself, but it would have been much better to go to class instead. Would have been easier otherwise.",
        "It's a difficult class, especially if your coding experience isn't strong, but coming from 118 you have all the tools to not struggle as much with the coding. I think if you put in effort, it's definitely a doable class. That being said, I couldn't have made it through without going to TA office hours twice a week and working with several people in the class.",

Whenever I'd go to lecture, I'd come out feeling more confused than when I went in. Labs were particularly unhelpful and disorganized as well, and it was clear that all of our homework assignments were taken from the other section, as we hadn't been taught a good amount of the material on there. I probably learned more from google in this class than anything else.",

        "Lectures were alright. At times Trimble seemed very out of touch with the students in the class. He teaches like there should be a prerequisite for the class in Linear Algebra. Many times I felt completely lost in the lectures, and I think a lot of people stopped going for this reason. I went to almost all the lectures and took good notes which helped in the end, but I'm not sure he was always effective in getting the main points across and making complex topic digestible for novices like myself. In the end, I learned mostly through the weekly homework assignments and studying for the final. So, most of the learning was self taught, but I thought the topics were extremely interesting and applicable to any career which I decide to undertake.",

        "This course was disorganized, there was no understanding for the standard of success on any assignment (homeworks or the midterm project), homeworks were returned extremely late.",
        "Maybe it's just my relative inexperience (I came straight from 118), but I feel like this course didn't actually do much to teach me. Not that I didn't learn things, but lectures felt like word vomit, and were mostly helpful for knowing what terms I would have to Google later.",
        "Professor Trimble seems like a nice person, but his lectures are very confusing and I often can't follow what we are supposed to learn.",
        "Professor Trimble is clearly an incredibly\u2013intelligent person, but I wish he\u2019d planned the course out more in advance. His lectures often felt haphazard and raw \u2014it\u2019s very qualitative advice, but I felt like the course lacked polish.",
        "Learned a lot, but also put in a lot of time and energy. At times it felt very overwhelming and unreasonable. Each homework took me like 10+ hours. As a student athlete with many other extracurriculars, it was extremely difficult and stressful at times to get assignments done in time. I guess that's just the struggle of being a student\u2013athlete at UChicago :(",

What we learned on assignments and homework had little to no correlation with what was on the final. Like topics we learned about was on the final but then several trick questions or uncovered components about optics we didn\u2019t cover was on the final and it was the most frustrating experience."

      "Thinking about your time in the class, what aspect of the instructor's teaching contributed most to your learning?": [
        "The professor's instruction was less than ideal. He was fun and engaging, and was often comical, but other than that it was difficult to take anything away from his lectures.",
        "Quite literally nothing. Trimble is probably the worst professor I've had at this university by far. Sometimes I'd go to the other section's class to understand the material a little better\u2013 Trimble taught the exact same material, but somehow made it 10x more incomprehensible. Though clearly intelligent, he is entirely unfit to teach students. He never updated the Canvas syllabus, rarely had lectures and ipnyb files uploaded before students reminded him, always put homeworks up late (we were supposed to have one homework per week, but since he was so behind on teaching, we had to delay several homeworks). Trimble would come to class entirely unprepared, not having rehearsed what he was going to teach us. His lectures were all over the place with no through line, and I deeply hope that he reads this course evaluation and thinks to put a little bit more effort into this class. Data science is not an easy subject to learn on your own, and I believe that 99% of the class had to teach themselves everything on their own.",

        "The instructor could think about teaching more from the perspective of the student and account for their ability to understand complex material as beginners in data science. This class could be organized in a more thoughtful way, similar to how the first course in this sequence was modeled after a class taught at Berkeley, Data 8. That class was much easier to follow and therefore learn from.",

        "The powerpoints as well as the frequent feedback on Ed I felt most contributed to my learning experience, as Professor Nussbaum was pretty consistent in helping us out within 24 hours of a question if we posted it on Ed. The grading on both exams were also very immediate, which I appreciated as then I could learn from the mistakes I made on the exam.",
        "One on one help and feedback in labs and office hours helped me learn how to properly implement code.",

This would be fine but since it means that attendance is pretty much mandatory and since the room was so small, there were students sitting on the floor during every lecture. I think if this introductory sequence class is going to continue being taught in those cramped Ryerson rooms, that progress check / attendance requirement should be modified somehow. (Or the registrar could just add another section or lower the section cap, but I don't think instructors have control of that)",

As long as the effort is put in to attend lectures, complete problem sets, attend office hours and review for the exam, this class should not pose a significant problem.",

The problem sets were interesting and challenged me at times but were ultimately irrelevant to the final exam (because it had no coding in Python on it). At the end of the day, even though I attended all the lectures I ended up having to self\u2013study this class before the final because this was so all over the place in the way the lectures and exams were structured.",

        "Trimble is the king of irrelevant tangents during lectures, making it very hard to identify what is actually class material and what is some random Trimble tangent. After having the other professors for 118, I'm quite disappointed by how little substantive understanding anyone could retain from Trimble's lectures. Most students simply stopped attending class and self\u2013taught.",
        "course was very disorganized. lectures felt like one\u2013off topics as there was little logical flow between them. i often felt confused about the main takeaways for each lectures and instead had to rely on homework and additional reading to understand course content.",
        "The class was really interesting content but was horribly organized from a teaching standpoint.",

        "professor trimble is very kind and always willing to help when asked questions (especially in office hours). amy was also really helpful in office hours!",
        "The zoom recordings",
        "Assignments, along with office hours and feedback on them, were probably the most helpful part. The course was organized on Canvas better than in the fall, which I really appreciated.",

      "What could the instructor modify to help you learn more?": [
        "Clearly define what will be tested. It was great that a lot of materials were covered including the intuition of concepts, but they could also be tangential to what is tested, and we didn't know what was tangential and what was testable material.",
        "Make lectures and lecture slides more clear and focused on the main ideas.",
        "Lectures",
        "I never quite understood what we were learning and how to apply it to anything outside of the homework. I think that adding a high level overview of the topic to be covered, including what it is, and how it is related to previous lectures would be very helpful in this. Including a weekly summary of the topics covered during that week would be very helpful too.",
        "I think Professor Trimble could explain some of the statistical concepts a bit more clearly; they were often hard to understand when he explained it",
        "Lectures could be more organized. At times, it felt like they were out of order or we covered some material more than once. The topics stressed in review sessions were different from those stressed in the lectures, so this made studying confusing.",
        "Organize the class more clearly (why did we circle back to random stuff at the end of the quarter like logistic regressions?). If the exam has no coding, teach how to do some problems without it (like how to make a dendrogram without Python, since the homework only prepared us to do data science using Python).",
        "i think that professor trimble\u2019s thinking is just on a much higher level than a lot of us, so it can be difficult to understand what he\u2019s trying to communicate at some times. also the final was extremely disorganized with lots of mistakes on the questions, so we spent time during the actual final rectifying that, which seems like an relatively avoidable situation (as it was already stressful enough taking the final without also having to account for so many changes in the actual exam while taking the exam)",

Maybe traditional psets might have been better for this course",

The assignments didn't fully follow from lectures \u2013 we briefly covered Django, but several weeks before the API assignment and not at such great detail as was necessary to complete the assignment. But Prof Krishnan recognized the difficulty we were having with the assignments (as it was the first quarter of having them) and adjusted accordingly.",

Assignments sometimes missed the mark on how they lined up with lectures (i.e. required us to learn new packages outside of class time with little mention in lectures) but all in all, when assignments were difficult, Prof. Krishnan and the TA's extended deadlines and encouraged office hours to make sure it was possible for everyone.",

As this is a required class for the data science major, I feel that further work could be done in refining the major's curriculum to avoid overlap with other required classes.",
        "My only complaint about this excellent course is that the difficulty of the project needs to be adjusted. The professor actually did an excellent job in realizing this along the way and was very accommodating about it. Nonetheless, although I think that having a quarter\u2013long project instead of independent assignments is a good idea, I think it should be divided into smaller and more approachable tasks, because it can become very overwhelming at times.",

The three \"quizzes\" were very doable, but they were challenging at times. But again, he was very generous with the partial credit which was very much appreciated. Class was interesting, and I would definitely recommend this course.",

It wasn't a bad course, but this didn't match my expectations. I don't think it was clearly communicated in the course description",
        "I think the course would work if we were able to stay on track with the homework, but because of pre\u2013requisites mismatching the 2nd homework got pushed back for a lot of people. If you've taken DATA 120 I think the second homework is doable in a week if you grind and definitely in 2 weeks."

Most CS classes see significant drop\u2013off over the course of a quarter, and the fact that CMSC 13600 did not was a testament both to how useful our lectures were, but also how well they were delivered and the high quality of content. This was the class I was least initially excited to take for the Data Science major, and is what I now consider the most useful theory class (though there's also plenty of application in the assignments) I've taken for it.",

The discussion sections were more instructive (I feel) mainly because your participation is mandatory for the grade and the questions used to apply concepts required a lot more thinking. I think the assignments of the class were interesting and really tested students's proficiency with the concepts presented in lecture (though I think the code quality requirements are a bit too stiff and unforgiving given that this is an intro class). Code quality makes up 50% of a student's assignment grade (10/20 total SNU scores are allotted just for \"code quality\", which is ambiguous to both newcomers and students with programming experience): too much, in my opinion.",

Homeworks were assigned weekly, and the grading scheme was unambiguous and generous; we had a table to assess our standing in the course, and were allowed resubmissions on all six assignments (giving us two weeks to complete ~six problems). A cumulative, two\u2013part project was assigned at the end of the quarter, and was appropriately challenging. I appreciate the efforts made by the instructors to emphasize learning over grade\u2013grubbing\u2014a stark contrast to other courses I've taken here.\n\nThe instructors and TAs were very responsive on Ed, so much so that I did not have to attend office hours once throughout the course. They also provided thorough feedback on each of our submissions, which helped me improve greatly. An online textbook was provided that gave additional insight into lecture material.\n\n\nFor anyone who has attempted the CS 150s: this is *nothing* like that. The instructors are actually competent, and the material is easily learnable with practice. This is very much a beginner\u2013friendly course. I'd even argue that the grading scheme was too lenient...",

TAs and Professors often seemed frustrated having to deal with so many students and seemed stand\u2013offish and snippety whenever you asked them a \"dumb\" question of sorts. On the online discussion page on Ed, a lot of this behavior appeared to carry over there as well. Over halfway through this quarter a queue system was implemented to control the flow of students showing up to TA and Professor office hours and seems to be a good way of managing students so far.",

        "Class is not the best for students without coding experience. They say no prior experience is necessary but the class is very fast paced for python newbies.",
        "The only bad thing about this course is how overcrowded it is. Despite the best efforts of the course staff and tons of coverage, they are still stretched too thin. As a result, getting to see someone in office hours can be difficult at times. The wait list app that was introduced late in the quarter seems to have done little to alleviate this issue. However, staff are very responsive on Ed, which was, for many questions, a quick and useful alternative to office hours.",
        "The lecture is not really helpful. The homework went from too easy to too hard suddenly, and there was insufficient practice with recursion and classes. I get out okay because I have some experience, but everyone I know who has had no prior experience really struggled.",

All of them were STEM majors. This is the first time I took a serious STEM course and now I see why my friends are dead, and why there is a mental health crisis among college students. It's not because of our bleak futures or a difficult job market. The suffering of young people today, their mental health problems, and the lives lost to suicide are entirely attributable to the environment created for students by courses such as these. Young people can't thrive in an alienated and inhumane environment. Please, if you are thinking about how to improve education in the future, don't make small changes like the grading system. Only a total reconceptualization of how you actually do the job of educating and how that education is structured can help address the mental crisis and stop people from taking their lives.\n\nI know that the department is trying to fix these things. I'd like to communicate that they are not doing a good job. Minor ameliorative efforts like changes to grading policy do not do enough to create an environment that doesn't make the lives of students a living hell. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way about the courses, and only implore those engaged in the planning and structuring of STEM education at the university to feel personally responsible for the consequences that the courses they create and teach have on the lives of their students. It doesn't have to be this way and if you take moral responsibility for how education is structured as a collective then it can actually be changed.

Also the virtual queue system was absolutely awful and severely contributed to my feeling that no one really cared about any individual student in the course.

        "I am so glad to be taking the course",
        "I would only recommend this class to someone with at least some exposure to computer science in the past (i.e. Java). While the first two weeks may be easy for everyone, the difficulty of the assignments increases rapidly after the add\u2013drop period ends. However, the course is still very doable if you are good with logic. The class will feel very easy if you have prior programming experience (you should consider taking the placement test instead) but challenging if you don't.",
        "GREAT",
        "It is a difficult class, be prepared to spend a lot of time on it if you have little to no prior experience in CS",
        "Professor Rogers can be somewhat offputting, but she is very helpful if you can get past her very straightforward criticism/attitude",
        "Prof Rogers is doing her best to provide education for 300 people at once. She's being forced to serve up a McDonaldsified educational experience to a bunch of people who want high paying careers as the good exchanged for their nearly $500,000 education. I have a lot of respect for the way that she tried to handle this dynamic and wish that the system that is destroying student mental health didn't also put such terrible pressures on professors. She doesn't deserve to have to go through this just like we don't deserve to have to go through this.",
        "Expect to dedicate a lot of time to each homework",
        "Very very tough assignments",
        "This is a very good class in that you learn an insane amount of information in 9 weeks. That being said, if you haven't taken a CS class before, it is very overwhelming. Especially because collaboration with other students in any form was essentially prohibited, this sometimes left me feeling a little desperate for help. The TAs and the professor were great at providing help, but they only have so much time. The course moves at a very fast pace, so if you are new to programming, it can feel like you're constantly trying to catch up, especially since many people in the class already had coding experience. It is a good class, and you will walk out of it a much better programmer, but be prepared to work hard if you don't have past experience.",
        "Requirements are very clear cut, but the fact that there is no leeway makes the class quite challenging.",

The learning curve is so steep that nothing sticks (ie dictionaries or classes or anything) until its too late and the homework is long gone to understand it. If you do not have prior exposure/understanding of python, DO NOT TAKE THIS AT ALL. TAKE YOUR OWN PYTHON CLASS FIRST AND THEN TAKE THIS CLASS. Only those who take 3 classes or have past exposure succeed. I am telling you, do NOTTTT take this class if you are blind to python. I pray that the 121 sequence for non\u2013majors comes back because this class tanks your gpa esp as a normal student looking to learn code.",

That said, I'd really like to congratulate the CS department, the improvement between CS 141 this winter and CS 151 last winter is clear. Grading is way more transparent, having a grading scale that we know about from day 1 helps a lot, feedback is overall much better and timely and lectures are also much better and more clear. The fact that we're learning Python, a much more used language, is also great and the projects make way more sense and are way more useful.",

I did not feel motivated during the final project, in which we had to navigate multiple files and classes, write many exception messages and keep track of what was written in each file just to create a hub of version numbers (like 1.2.3). This is the first introductory class to CS, so the project should be something that excites us and motivates us to keep going with CS.

The SNU grading scale is such that you won't be able to get an A unless u have basically perfect homework and a 90% combined average midterm + final grade, which is kind of impossible for someone without prev CS experience (like me, an English major who's new to programming). If you haven't been learning CS before, I would recommend just learning a bit of everything beforehand to get used to the concepts. If you find CS interesting, it's worth the effort. Also, definitely do practice problems on your own or search up YouTube videos on the topic. Preview the topics in the textbook before the day of lectures and do the exercises there too. Start the homework early in the week (weekend or Monday if they're due Friday) and always go back to them before midterms and finals. Try to redo them from memory, ON PAPER, IN 1 TRY.

This was in addition to spending hours on each of the HWs and projects.\nTo be fair, I definitely learned a lot. However, for a beginner programmer, be prepared to dedicate the majority of your week to this class if you want to do remotely well.",

Assignments are overly difficult and stop you from being able to practice the little things. We would learn if and else statements and then go straight into difficult application problems without ever getting problems to help just get down the basics. The assignments will take you 6+ hours everyday if you are new to coding. I went to office hours and the prof was very rude to me and made me uncomfortable. She was rude and talked to me like I was stupid. She treated me like I was a burden, even though the point of office hours is to help!!! After that I never went again.

I believe the homework assignments in the first half of the quarter were acceptable, but as weeks passed by, the difficulty suddenly increased immensely and as someone with no prior experience in coding, I struggled immensely to catch up and complete the work.

        "So difficult!! Possibly because that's the nature of the CS major at UChicago. Even more difficult than the CS major intro class at CMU, which my friend was there.",
        "Be wary of this course. It's very hard and the homeworks assigned every week were so stressful. Every week I would have so much anxiety that I would not be able to complete the assignments. While I agree this difficulty is part of CS, the problems just felt overly hard.",
        "The grading system needs revision. It allows no room for improvement with respect to grades",
        "Challenging course for what it's worth. First half of the quarter will be pretty easy, but don't be fooled. It definitely ramps up toward the end and much more difficult material is covered. Unique grading system that takes a second to get used to, but relatively easy to track where you fall for a final grade. It is very, very difficult to receive a flat A. While this is the first intro class for comp sci, I personally would not consider this an intro course. The first half is definitely introductory level, but the second half is not (IMO). The average on our midterm was an 80 (median 85 so it was left skewed), which is crazy. There is no curve on the exams. The class will inevitably have lots of people who are already familiar with python or similar programming languages. Take that as you will. Multiple hours spent on homeworks. Definitely post on Ed and go to office hours to help, although the queue system for OH is dumb.",
        "This course favors those who have prior experience in Python programming and when I mean favor, I mean that you will suffer a lot if you are not proficient enough with your programming skills. The grading scheme in this course is incredibly strict for an introduction course. To get an A in this course, you not only need to get 100 on all homework but have perfectly clean code for almost all of them as well. For a beginner, this is almost impossible. I understand that codes should all be able to run near perfectly in order for a satisfactory score to be given, but I think using the SNU scale actually eliminates partial credit for work done. For example, let's say someone gets 80% of all their code running and has mostly clean code. This doesn't sound bad until you actually read the grading scheme because an 80% actually gets you an N score on most assignments, meaning that you are actually in danger of failing this course unless you get almost a 100 on the paper exams. There is a huge disparity in the level of difficulty of material covered in class and the actual homework assignments. I think you should spend more time actually doing difficult questions in class or perhaps giving some hints. I know that those who can know coding beforehand may find it boring, but this class is currently heavily skewed towards these people. That is why this class does not feel like an \"intro\" course for those who are genuinely beginners. I think there should be a separate intro course with no prerequisites for non\u2013majors/minors while this course should have some prerequisites, like some prior knowledge of programming.",
        "Great, engaging introduction to programming. Fast\u2013paced but manageable, and really well organized to help you build skills quickly.",
        "If you have no previous exposure to coding, it can be a very hard course because it goes very fast and some concepts are just defined in the book which is very long",
        "The lectures really did not help towards doing well on the midterm or final. the grading structure is not great either: makes it very difficult to get an A even if you put in a lot of time on the homeworks",

        "Paper tests are so stupid and against purpose",
        "Even though the course is generally suitable for beginners (no experience in Python), it is very strange to see people who already have a lot of experience in this programming language in this course, because given that a lot of people already understand certain topics, the instructor or TA may be going faster than they should and the curve system (or just adapting assignments for people with zero experience) does not work at all. Get ready for a rigid grading system: to get an A or an A\u2013, you need to do almost everything perfectly.",
        "Since this course does aim to teach a lot within 10 weeks, being able to both solidify fundamental skills while also advancing through topics rapidly is extremely difficult /nearly impossible to succeed at.",
        "Although I thoroughly believe all resources were exhausted in providing help for students, there still couldve been more office hours or ways to get help.",
        "I came into this class without previous coding experience and it was a huge mistake. It was so fast\u2013paced that it was really hard to grasp the concepts and the limited 30 minute slots of office hours time made it hard to get all the extra support I needed on the assignments. The TAs were super nice and helped a lot, but but my limited amount of time with them combined with my lack of precious coding experience made me struggle a lot in the course. Professor Rogers also isn\u2019t the most understanding/patient with new coders and there was an occasion where she raised her voice at me for not understanding an explanation she gave, which made the learning environment very uncomfortable for me and disincentivized me from seeking out help from her in the future. The class expects you to learn and grasp the concepts very quickly and the class is a lot more stress than it\u2019s worth, so if you\u2019re like me and don\u2019t have a coding background or aren\u2019t planning on majoring in it, I don\u2019t recommend taking this course.",
        "I wish there were less exercises on homework assignments. Often were hugely time consuming, especially because of the \"no collaboration\" rule which meant you had to design your work schedule around available office hours, which were sometimes impossible to book. I really appreciate how the instructors and TAs are so dedicated to providing resources for students (ED etc) but wish there was some leeway so it wasn't so time consuming. It is a huge detriment to continuing with CS. I also wish the discussion sections were a bit more tailored to the homeworks (maybe half exercise half office hours walk in style)."

I think there are some tools that we need to know or learn before attempting to do the homework assignments and unless you are working with the assumption that everyone has basic programming skills, the professor should either lower the difficulty of assignments or provide more help during class by walking us through some of the things we might need to do in the homework later. It is good to challenge your students intellectually, but do give them some tools to work with first, especially so that those who find coding challenging as beginners can catch up with their peers. Also, maybe you can post the lecture codes for other students to look at on their own later. I think there's far too little material for us to study off on when preparing for exams.",

Staying on top of topics and being able to quickly understand concepts is very important for this class, and it is important to study these outside of class time in order to best internalize and strengthen these concepts.",

When we began going deeper into classes, recursion, trees, etc, it became much more difficult. This course was very challenging. Required lots of hours and sometimes just brute force to get through the homeworks. Exams were tough as well (and seemed more difficult than the Autumn 22 exams we had for reference). I would recommend coming into the class with some Python\u2013specific knowledge and continue to use outside resources to help you learn as you go through the class.",

For homework assignments, there is an expectation that you already know what the basics before even attempting to solve the more challenging ones. If you do not have prior experience, you need to be willing to spend a lot of time studying and doing the homework. It will take up most of your time for the quarter.",

The way the course is structured is far more suitable for students who have knowledge of topics beforehand.",

        "The lectures were very important in learning the material. The homeworks and projects helped make the content of the course feel more concrete. The discussions were also great ways to apply the material we were learning in lecture.",
        "discussion sections and homework assignments were very helpful to learning (challenging but integral)",
        "Lectures are useful, but once material gets advanced they can be a bit confusing or disorienting. The discussion sections really help you get a grasp on material and allow you to work with other students on problems.",
        "HW assignments connected directly to the class content.",
        "most learning occurred while doing the assignments and the lectures provided useful context for those assignments.",
        "discussions helped prepare for exams",
        "Lectures and office hours were probably the most useful. Discussions were more or less helpful, having the solutions posted was the most helpful part.",
        "The lectures were a little fast paced but the instructor did a good job of answering questions wherever he could and slowing down when asked to.",
        "Mostly learned through doing the PSets/lectures. Discussions were good to get practice/reinforce material",
        "labs allowed for hands on experience on how to solve issues (similar to exams)",
        "Lectures were extremely applicable and useful. Professor Elmore was excellent at answering any questions we had about what he was doing. During each lecture he would simply show examples of whatever data structure or concept we were learning about, implementing them in ipython and considering different methods, applications for the structure, and thus understanding how the structure worked and why it was relevant. The lectures were thus extremely useful, whether for the nature of programming or otherwise, because I felt equipped by not just the notes I took from lecture but also by seeing the thought process behind the application of each object to apply myself with the homework. The homework was also extremely useful. It emphasized concrete uses of what we were learning, which helped me think about real\u2013life applications of the knowledge (besides enjoying learning about these concepts for their own sake). It also gave me ample opportunity to make mistakes, to implement the objects we learned about many times, and to approximate pythonic code. Finally, however, some of the problems were truly challenging, forcing me to better understand the problem I was trying to solve, its applications to other problems in the same problem set, and thus making me a better programmer. I must say that the projects felt simply like glorified homework assignments\u2013\u2013however, they had the unified theme of solving the task of creating a library hub, which I suppose warrants to some extent the idea of calling them projects. In addition, some assignment problems had vague wording that failed to specify the requirements of the solution\u2013\u2013specifically, split_lines on HW 4 did not detail what to do when the string was greater than the length\u2013\u2013this was by necessity learned through trial and error with pytest. Thus when on the final we had to create a dictionary with values of None for each index in the list that we were given, I had no trouble doing so, because the assignments we had been given had entailed similar processes. The discussion sections, although my TA was kind and helpful, did not really help much with my understanding until the last one\u2013\u2013and even then, I had missed a couple of relevant lectures, so it was possible that I would have seen similar examples previously otherwise. They simply felt like a repetition of what we had already learned. I think if the discussion sections were optional, the course overall would adapt itself more to different feelings of comfort with the material. As a final note: I did NOT feel like the midterm or final were \"out to get me\" or meant to \"weed me out\" or \"tank my grade\". I don't believe any of the problems went beyond the scope of what we would necessarily have learned by completing the homeworks, and thus I don't think any content on the midterm or final was unfair as far as I can remember.",

        "I didn't personally feel very challenged, but I don't think the course is at all to blame for that as I had more background in the subject than some. I still think its a great course and it can't hurt to do some review, but perhaps if the placement exams allowed for more languages this would result in different placements for some.",

        "The grading is a little harsh that you have to fulfil so many things to get an A",
        "Having already taken computer science classes in the past (but not enough python to place out of the course entirely), I found that the material was generally far too easy. The code quality grades on assignments also felt somewhat arbitrary, and this became a source of stress because the grading scheme for the course offered little room for error.",

I know people in this class don't have the prerequisite knowledge to exactly understand what is happening behind the code, but I think that the idea of code quality could be implemented more into examples during lectures or maybe even discussions. I think just having more examples and exposure to these ideas could eliminate some of the frustration people feel.",

        "Fix the office hour system. Midway through the quarter, they created a new system that was very confusing and often required students to wait hours for appointments. I once waited 5 hours for an appointment just to be ignored. I ended up never getting contacted by a teacher or a TA. When you \"queue up\" for an appointment, there is no clear indication of how long you will need to wait.",

I find in person office hour completely useless (due to extreme inefficiency) so the instructors should think more about how to improve that experience. However, lots of gratitude for instructors and TAs as their help over Ed is extremely essential to my learning.\nExams: okay sure we need exams but can we talk about the fact that we are writing code on paper? It is an absurd practice. My roommate saw my scratch papers and asked why I wrote code on paper and I told her that I had to practice writing code on paper correctly for the exam. This is quite absurd. But if this has to continue being the case, can we get more practice of writing code on paper correctly from the class? It is one thing to be able to write code on laptop and debug to make sure everything works and another thing to write code on paper without debugging and still get everything to work. For example, maybe we need 2h of discussion sessions every week. Or, we should have some weekly quizzes (not graded) where students are required to write codes down on paper.

The burden should not fall on genuinely new students of computer science as to how they can cope with people who have done coding for years in advance. As a first year, it's just demoralising struggling through an introductory class where others are fleeting by since they just have so much experience. While the homeworks and rigorous and help you gain a substantial amount of knowledge in a shorter period of time, the expectations are nearly impossible to reach and there is a big disparity as to what is taught in the lectures and what is tested in the HW.",

Also while we get basic instruction in lecture, the psets are exceedingly complex and makes for bad practice of the skills from class.",
        "The office hours structure towards the end was terrible. People had to strategize when they would go into office hours to get help on the project. For example, if you have a question that you could not solve even with ED, you had to consider whether to try getting into office hours and risk not getting into future office hours in the next day or two or week (thus preventing you from getting help on an EVEN harder problem later on) or save your office hours \"pass\" for the EVEN harder problem later on. Basically, you could be really struggling with your current problem but have to consider whether it may be the hardest problem you will come across\u2014you will get into office hours like twice max so you had to use them wisely. Also, you could wait the whole day and not get into office hours. My friend had not gone to OH for the whole week and still had to wait two days to get in. You only have a week and a half or so for each project so there really is not much time to sit around being stuck. Also, office hours were 30 minute sessions for ~5 people which is not that much time per person. It takes a while to understand the problem, let alone fix it. The professors were really unhelpful on ED while the TAs were mostly helpful. The professors never really answered your questions and gave either vague statements or more questions (also vague) as responses. The test cases for the project were also pretty bad and did not cover all scenarios. The way the test cases were written was really hard to understand\u2014you spent more time deciphering what you were testing rather than deciphering what the test case yielded in your code. The class moved a little fast considering how little support\u2014you could barely get any help. I think the professors should be less stingy with their help and provide clear answers to questions; e.g. clarification questions on doc\u2013strings for functions we are supposed to write. How are we supposed to write the function if the doc\u2013string is vague and we do not even know what the function is supposed to do? I literally showed my CS professor the doc\u2013string for a function on the project and even they could not understand what the function was supposed to do??? (Another prof wrote the doc\u2013string apparently) Then for a question about a doc\u2013string that the professors refuse to clarify on ED, I now have to consider whether to waste my one of maybe two chances of getting into office hours on a not\u2013that\u2013even\u2013complicated question?? LIKE I KNOW THERE ARE HARDER PROBLEMS DOWN THE LINE. Anyways, thank you for listening.",

I personally spent more time on this class than my other three classes combined, and I still felt that I was graded unfairly because the curve was ruined by students with past AP CS experience. Overall, I learned a lot in the class, but it was so fast\u2013paced that it felt unreasonable. I would not recommend this course to an unexperienced coder.",

        "I thought this was a really good introductory course to Python. It was challenging but doable, and I feel like I've come out being able to code in basic Python, which was my goal going into the course. The homeworks are time consuming, but they really do help foster a better understanding of the concepts you learn each week. TAs and profs are also super helpful in office hours. I think the grading scheme relies a bit too much on the midterm and final, especially considering that as beginner coders, it's hard to code on paper in a timed environment. Otherwise, it was a great course",
        "I think the redesign of the intro computer sequence works pretty well since we know get to learn Python, which is more practical in real life. But the demand for the class is so high that the department just doesn't have enough staff to accommodate all students, which results in long wait time for office hours (the online waiting system works better, but it's not intuitive).",
        "The grading system is unnecessarily stressful and complicated, especially in the fact that one late homework assignment is an automatic B+ in the class even if you do everything else perfectly.",
        "I liked this class because the problems presented were practical and pragmatic; problems that you might actually encounter in a work field.",
        "this course is great for learning the basics of object oriented programming in Python and thinking like a computer scientist.",
        "Thank you so much for this course!",
        "I wish we spent less time worrying about the most pythonic way to do something, and spent more time focusing on the concept at hand. Also the grading scheme makes literally no sense, please fix that.",
        "This is a well organized course that is standardized and teaches you about how to get into programming even without any past experience.",
        "I love this course",
        "If you know nothing about Python before 141, you should definitely brush up on it beforehand, because it will save you many many hours of having to learn it on the fly, which from what I've seen with friends taking the course, is incredible time consuming",
        "I feel as though I learned a ton from the projects. However, there were points where I was just like \u2018this isn\u2019t working, & I really don\u2019t understand why\u2019. Ed was a great resource & faculty was very active in answering questions, but this didn\u2019t stop me from being stuck on one step for at times 10 hours at a time. I get that I\u2019m a senior taking this course, but I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d find this class accessible if I were a freshman & extra gung ho (& I\u2019m a math major). I really just wanted to learn a little bit about how to code! & I feel as though I should have an accessible option to do this in college (yes I understand that this is the University of Chicago). For one, I wish that course staff could find a way to not set arbitrary benchmarks on assignments & set a grading scale that (I\u2019d be willing to guess) at least 10% of the students fell off of; only for us to later learn that this scale is flexible (which is very helpful but doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019ve been very stressed the last 4 weeks). Really, I feel as though my central issue with the course was that institutionally this class really is not accessible. To hear students mumble under their breath thoughts of self harm is not only an obvious sign that something here is wrong, but such a culture can be triggering for other students that just happen to be in office hours. Course staff as individuals really did want us to succeed. Whenever you could talk to them in office hours or on Ed, it was clear that you guys want to help us. But seriously, the current culture of CSMC 141 is the least healthy I have seen in my college experience as a senior. & it seems to me that you\u2019re all aware that we have wanted to lose our minds this entire quarter, but agreed at the beginning of the quarter that your standards were going to be your standards. I think that in a language learning class, the framework should be flexible. This is based on the core belief that we\u2019re a bunch of motivated people, who are going to try our best at learning coding. [For instance many math classes have it where (simplistically) it\u2019s either 50% homework, 50% final, or, if your grade works out better this way, is 100% final. In our case, say 20% projects 10% discussion attendance & 70% exam based. I feel as though something more like this would be incredibly helpful for enabling students to learn from the course, & find ways of learning CS that are good for them while still meeting y\u2019all\u2019s standards, but not lose their minds along the way.\n\nAlso, the virtual queue for office hours led to way more cheating, for the record. Crazy that frustrated students who are (1) unsure if they will ever get help (2) are under the impression that they are about to fail a college course & (3) now left unsupervised are likely to band together. The most annoyed I ever was in this course was overhearing a group of students (I\u2019m nosy) saying they were all at 100 on project 1, opting to band together, & managing to edit each other\u2019s code to get to 180 each after like an hour. After an hour I was still exactly where I had started, & by the end of the day of S/N & just that whole process was really annoying, but you\u2019re aware a ton of other people aren\u2019t acting ethically, are doing better as a result, & are unlikely to be caught, make you feel like you\u2019re inherently at a disadvantage in the course for trying to interpret the guidelines literally.",

Once we got into software engineering the lectures felt less helpful; there were definitely some good tips for teamwork and debugging though they probably could have been condensed into fewer lectures. May have been nice to have some in\u2013class time to work with our teams. My discussion section didn't feel very helpful as my TA didn't seem to have enough expertise with the homework assignments to help us (though I liked that the sessions were useful for the homework, rather than the be\u2013a\u2013computer problems of CS 141 which were challenging and didn't feel super helpful). Homeworks were rewarding but challenging; lots of details given for how to implement them. I found it really frustrating that we were limited to how many office hours we could attend and that we would have to be on\u2013call for them \u2013 sometimes I'd get an email halfway though an office hours session and I'd have to jump up and run; if I hadn't been checking my email periodically while working I wouldn't have known until it was too late.",

Discussion sections were generally a good source of support, and not making them mandatory was a great decision. OH (if you could find a time) also were very helpful.\nCons \u2013 The homeworks were incredibly tedious and not very well written. They were a massive step\u2013up from 14100, very long, and often did not make expectations clear with regards to output format. The test cases themselves were not comprehensive and did not give very helpful messages if you failed, which made debugging much harder. The final project required us to create a functional GUI for our checkers game using PyGame, which was never taught. The pandas and numpy homework also told us to figure out stuff that we were never taught. Thankfully, they took out the Chimera stuff because I had no clue what was going on there.",

        "Often, what we learnt in class, the homeworks, and the projects weren't exactly coherent. They sort of add up individually to contribute to learning.",
        "I loved this class. Found it appropriately challenging, very interesting, and very useful. The only thing is that I felt like lectures in the last 3 or so weeks were a bit strange. Some of the lectures about \"how to work in a team on projects\" were not particularly useful.",
        "I don't think the grading scheme is good for this course. It is practically impossible to get an A without spending a crazy amount of time (or already knowing everything that's going to be taught). And even then, the midterm determined the entire grade for this course (and, if you get even just 1 N on hw, you are already bumped down half a letter grade. Frankly, I think it's crazy to require basically perfect hw, a perfect final project, and above a 90 on the midterm.\n\nIf we ignore the grading scheme, the lectures of this course were awesome. I very much enjoyed the information taught, the discussion sections, and Shaw as a professor. I just wish the grading was a little more reasonable.",
        "better than 141",
        "This is a wonderful introductory CS class! As someone with zero coding experience prior to the 140s sequence, I feel like I am leaving the class with confidence in my coding skills and have become a better programmer in just 9 weeks.",
        "horrible grading system. not everyone can think through coding on the spot during exams. some people simply need time to think over. i feel that having in person exams for cs is not fair to everyone. not sure what the ideal way should be but this was definitely not it.",
        "Professor Shaw is a great teacher and lecturer, but they should really plan the course better. I feel like the last 2.5 weeks were wasted while we rushed through everything before the midterm.",
        "Class time was often spent covering extreme basics that were too simple to be helpful on the homework",
        "Too much work is expected for milestone 2 of the project. Shifting it back for a week would be much better. Also, the later part of the class (the software development part) feels very disorganized and unclear. Getting A in the class basically requires completing each homework well plus 90+ in the mid\u2013term so there ends up to be much more pressure compared to a normal numerically graded class.\nBesides these factors, overall it is a great class.",
        "hard class, you need to work a lot",
        "Honestly, I have no idea what this course was supposed to teach me or why the last four weeks were necessary. The first 4 weeks were great \u2013 graphs, trees and algorithms. Then we pivoted into data analysis tools, but we only ever scraped the surface so we never learnt enough to do anything useful with Pandas and NumPy \u2013 not even enough to do the homework! After a week of that, we went into principles of software design, which is nice but could have been done in far fewer classes or completely covered in notes \u2013 there's no reason to waste weeks of valuable class time on content that I spend a couple hours reading about and understand fully. mypy was a handy tool but then we spent an entire class learning about the features of PyCharm which highkey felt like a paid advertisement. This course needs some cohesion \u2013 everyone I know started skipping classes towards the end because they were so useless and so unrelated to the graded assignments. They could have done so much more with the second half of this course but it was all so mundane.",
        "Please work out the right way to facilitate learning in CS. At least, do not make us learn pandas and numpy.",
        "The homework was super well written, clear and fun to do, especially the second one.",
        "Professor Shaw is wonderful. He is very nice and his lectures are extremely clear and approachable. However, the assignment instructions are often articulated in convoluted and confusing ways, with important information missing. Sometimes you won't know what data type the autograder expects, and you have to figure it out through trial and error. Also, information is spread out in the canvas page, numerous links in the canvas page, and Ed, often making them hard to find. These problems were present with CS14100 as well.",
        "I wish an A didn't require a 90 on the midterm.",
        "Discussion sections were focused on the homework assignments for the first part of the quarter and were made optional. I went to the first one and the TA refused to get into the weeds of the code, only focusing on high\u2013level concepts that I already understood. I didn't go again, but I think that the approach switched over to something more closely approaching last quarter later on. That approach was highly successful and helpful and should be replicated in 142, in my opinion. Having a required discussion section that emphasizes concepts applicable to the homework, and giving students a packet with example code, is a great way for students to learn.",
        "Extremely well designed, also extremely time consuming and just hard.",

I appreciated that they let us work with a partner on one of the assignments. Discussion sections were also very helpful because we could ask for help on the homework. These were much better than in CMSC 141.",

The discussion I attended would put hints to the homework on the board and go over very basic stuff. For example, the discussion about git went over three commands and very simple stuff described in the sequence before this one."
      ],
      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "Honestly, after the midterm, lectures are optional. They don't lecture any new things after what you learn for the midterm. The project just applies everything that you've learned and you use logic to solve all the problems, which they don't really teach in the lectures. The discussion section/recitations sessions are also basically completely superfluous. The best way to go through this course is attending all (or most) classes before the midterm, then only going to office hours after it.",
        "I really enjoyed 142, thought the final project was set up very well and appreciated just having a midterm and no final.",
        "Really enjoyed the project and the teamwork aspect of this class, although I feel that earlier in the course would have benefitted from discussion sections much like the problem solving CS 141 discussion sections instead of the TA reading off slides about Git for 5 minutes and everybody leaving since it's optional. Suggested changes: problem solving discussion sections until the midterm, required discussion sections, better discussion topics (discussion was very boring, since some of the Git or team work stuff was obvious, or could have been taught in class at the last 5 minutes.) I learned a lot and had a lot of fun though!",
        "The course felt a bit disjointed. The lectures in the first 5 weeks were very good and helped cement content needed for the midterm. But after the midterm, the lectures were absolutely pointless. They were basically just lengthy, aimless discussions about intangible principles of software engineering. Most people stopped showing up. I understand that they want us to get practice with software development, but the transition between the first half of the class and the second half was abrupt.",
        "The final project felt poorly designed. It didn't require any of the concepts we learned in CS 141, and the signposts were more of an annoyance than something that helped guide the project. It required minimal collaboration, since the collaborative portion was small enough that one person could easily do it, especially because we had done some of the tasks necessary for that portion on the more challenging, interesting homeworks. I think the course could have definitely covered more content than it did, CS 141 did the bulk of the conceptual work. Some lectures also felt redundant, where we would spend the entire time tracing out one example of a pathfinding algorithm or data structure. Intuition of these things is of course useful, but spending the whole 50 minutes on it was excessive.",
        "I really like the structure of the class.",
        "Again like the sequence before this class, I don't really feel I should of been placed into this class. I also feel the grading system of this class to not work well for many students, including me. By this I mean the SNE system where if I have a semi\u2013bad midterm and/or final then the max grade I can get in the class is incredibly affected. Say I had really bad test anxiety or just had a bad test day, then I could go from an A+ to max a B from a single test. I understand these drastic changes to not be very uncommon in UChicago classes, but I don't feel they work and can be very upsetting."

        "For a 2nd intro sequence course, it feels very difficult even for students with multiple years of CS experience",
        "The worst part of this course is that the TAs felt really unorganized near the end. Multiple times for the course project, TAs would give my group and I contradictory advice (or fail to say something that another TA would heavily warn against) making me feel reluctant to change in my code as the course went on.\n\nChimera could have also been introduced much better. The lectures only covered very cursory and basic usage, and the uploaded (uncovered) lecture notes only explained Game Logic side of Chimera. When it came to incorporating GUI, TUI, and Bots with Chimera, it felt like students were left to figure it out for themselves, with only the basic examples as a guide.",
        "Its different to give a general statement about this course, there were some interesting stuff like the algorithms, but we merely learned them in concept and never really experimented with them ourselves, including the project. Furthermore, the skills that we use for the final project had little to no relation to what we learned in class for the second half of the quarter.",
        "The course has a sharp decrease in quality after the midterm. The lectures on the software development process felt too high\u2013level for me to gain any useful insight beyond what was covered in the lecture notes or just a google search."

        "There were some questions on the midterm of the type \"use Dijkstra's algorithm to traverse the following graph...\", or in general practicing the algorithms we were taught in class by hand. I think the practice problems for that might have been on Canvas, but I am still unsure exactly where to find them. Making that clearer would have been very helpful.\n\nAlso, the homework instructions were sometimes a bit unclear on what my code was exactly expected to produce. To be fair, I only encountered this problem on the pandas homework, but I had to guess how I was supposed to filter/pre\u2013process data based on the unit test exceptions, which was frustrating.\n\nFinally, I know we were told to frequently check Ed for this course, but I would have preferred if some important announcements for the course would have been put on Canvas instead. Ed emails me about some important posts, but I only realized this halfway through the quarter because gmail kept marking emails from Ed as spam. Also, I appreciate having fewer places to check for important information.\n\nReally, the above are nitpicks, and taking this course was overall a very good experience!"

Learning about Data Structures and Algorithms is very difficult, and the grading scheme was in no way adjusted for us to be learning it so much. For example, if we miss one task worth >= 15% on one homework assignment, we already lose our ability to get an A, which seems like a very dry grading scheme, especially for a course that should encourage us to learn, and one that is taken by many non\u2013majors.",

The Pandas/Numpy assignment was probably the worst in this respect, which although it was understandably unclear in the sense that it was purposefully meant to make you go look up things online, there were multiple ways of getting the same data and the tests only allowed for specific formats that I really struggled to find out how to create.",

This didn't give me much time to implement and debug the GUI, and our group didn't end up with a fully implemented project. Maybe the milestones for the project could be timed differently, or maybe there could be an option to do a smaller individual project (though I understand the point of the software development part of the course is to have us work with other people).",

        "This course felt extremely ill\u2013conceived, and I'm really not sure what it was meant to do. Whereas 141 felt like a pretty standard and relatively general introduction to programming, this course covered a handful of very specific topics in very little depth, with no apparent purpose to any of it. It seems (based on how homeworks were written) that assignments were made deliberately awkward in order to \"prepare students for a job in software engineering\"\u2013\u2013but not everybody is taking the course with the goal of becoming a software engineer. The purpose of an intro sequence should be to prepare students for more advanced coursework, not a job, but I don't see how having rudimentary understanding of pandas or knowing three algorithms using graphs is going to help me in future CS courses. The last half of the course contained almost no new material at all, and a lot of information given in the last few weeks was repeated over several lectures. It doesn't really feel like this course was thought out at all, and I really wish the department had just kept the old intro sequences.",

        "The weekly homework assignments and final project was my main resource for learning. The lectures were often very critical to my understanding, but at other times, I felt like I could miss them and not lose out too much. The discussion sections, especially in the first few weeks, were very helpful in doing the homework assignments and learning about the homework topics more deeply.",
        "Lectures (when we covered new material and not software dev best practices) were extremely good! Of course homework was also necessary to us understanding the class material too. Discussion sections were less helpful, but still good\u2013\u2013it was nice to have a TA there who could check our ideas and guide us in the right direction for homework assignments.",
        "Lectures were a little slow and dwelled a little too much on Python details, but were nevertheless helpful in introducing theoretic topics. Discussion sessions were honestly quite useless because there's a big gap in the understandings of the students attending; half the class are way too advanced and the other half are asking very basic questions. Assignments were quite fun in terms of playing with Python."

      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "the class fell off heavily once we got to the project stage. felt there wasn't much learning in class at that point, not saying remove the project, but i would restructure how it is taught \u2013\u2013 maybe compress the project stuff while continuing to teach more programming (perhaps functional programming which got only 1 lecture but seemed really cool)",
        "The first half of the course was amazing, but the second half with the focus on \"software development\" felt really weird. I get we're supposed to be getting some practical skills but the lectures for this portion of the course just felt completely useless. I think in future iterations the lectures should continue to focus on more theory and what we were doing in the first half. We could still have a project that teaches us the development heuristics, working as a team etc. I will say that this course is pretty trivial compared to 141 due to the laissez discussion of software development and chill project. Overall solid class. Just wish there was more of what was in the first half!",
        "These comments are about the course structure, NOT about Professor Morgan. Although Prof. Morgan was a great instructor, the course content was standardized across the 6 sections and its design was completely horrible and unhelpful.\n\nFirstly, the course lectures (which were standardized across CS 142) were far too theoretical and abstract. There were few examples of code and students would be expected to pick up completely new concepts and apply them to homework immediately that weekend without any time to digest the implementation details. Although this was alright for me with some background in trees and graphs, I experienced this first\u2013hand during the week on numpy and pandas, when we were expected to get used to the various libraries and functions within the span of days. This is rather unrealistic and induces unnecessary stress.\n\nSecondly, the course lectures on software development felt like an afterthought which simply took away lecture time from more relevant topics. (Again, this is not Prof. Morgan's fault.) Instead of focusing on other more interesting ideas like data structures and functional programming, we spent extended lectures discussing the ideation process without any concrete way to implement these ideas in our code.\n\nThirdly, the course project itself was not well integrated into the modules on software development. The project details came far too late and we were given one week to flesh out the implementation details. Furthermore, the experience of collaboration in every group was very different and in some groups, one member's lack of adherence to the design classes /methods could jeopardize other members' code and implementation. Hence, there is no objective way to judge the integration achieved within the group. Certain members are far more reliant on other members and are simply left to the mercy of their unexpected and unannounced changes.\n\nFourthly, the TAs for the course were very unprofessional and inconsistent with their advice. One TA told us that certain features of our design were good, before another TA informed us next week that we would need to revise and revamp them. During code reviews, the TAs seem unsure of their advice and flip\u2013flop between their recommendations. There needs to be more thorough and cosistent training for the TAs so that we can get the advice we need during office hours.\n\nLastly, the grading for the course is far too strict. We need all \"S\"s on our code and a grade of 90 on the midterm, which means consistent work throughout the quarter can be derailed by just one sub\u2013par showing. This creates unnecessary stress and does not reflect the overall coding ability of a student. Instead, grading should be cumulative so students have a chance to redeem themselves if they improve their performance.",
        "Big jump, I think, from 141.",
        "The written midterm would work a lot better if it were only on the theoretical topics of graphs and trees, or it included some of the software design stuff. The handwritten code part is difficult for some people and easy for others, and doesn't really test anything useful or help us learn how to code.",
        "I literally lost 7 pounds in 4 weeks without changing my diet/exercise mostly because of the stress from this course. Please be prepared to be overwhelmed in the 2nd half of the quarter if you take it. Also, the software design unit seemed disorganized and didn't really fit in with the rest of the course or with CS 141.",
        "i liked everything. I thought the homeworks were really fun.",
        "This was an okay course. Weeks 1\u20132 were review of first quarter material, and weeks 7\u20139 I don't think I got much out of since I'm not interested in software development, and a lot of the material felt like common sense best practices (not worth spending that much time one). The other material in the weeks between was really good though! I think the pace of lectures could be a bit faster when going over algorithms and data structures. Specifically AVL\u2013balancing and DFS/BFS I think could have been a lot quicker when describing how they work.",
        "A little too easy honestly. We can tell that the CS department here could use some experience in terms of course design. As an intro\u2013level class, some of the topics introduced (specifically the dat\u2013sci packages) would not be relevant to the CS major."

        "Speaking from personal experience, I find that I derive greater benefits from engaging in lectures. When the material is presented in a clear and easily understandable manner, it tends to stick in my memory more effectively. Therefore, lectures hold a higher value for me compared to the alternative option of labs, which were also available for this course. While labs provide a hands\u2013on learning experience, I tend to absorb information more readily through attentive listening and note\u2013taking during lectures. It's a learning style that suits me best and enhances my memorization abilities.",

        "Adam Shaw is a really good professor who clearly cares about his students and our learning.",

It was very hard to tell what the instructors wanted on the homework as they used an autograder that was extremely inflexible and they did not release it to the class before the homework was due. The grading of the homework was extremely harsh and took forever.",

        "I was really worried about this course after 142, which I found to be really demanding and overwhelming. But this class was the perfect amount of challenging and interesting, while also not taking over my entire 9 weeks.",
        "Adam Shaw is an excellent professor. He has a ton of experience and wants to help everyone succeed. Make sure you go to the labs!",
        "Overall a great class. Work was returned too late for us to learn from feedback for tests/future assignments. Grading was frequently erroneous, taking points off when I clearly did something right, but regrade requests were addressed promptly.",
        "Overall, I think this course ran out of material a little early. It's just still new and needs to work out the kinks.",
        "Honestly there were a lot of problems with this course. The grading was super behind and I did not get any feedback on my problems sets. After the midterm, there were a lot of lectures that kind of seemed pointless, with different sections covering different things. Hopefully it is organized better next year. That being said, I did enjoy the problem sets a lot and thought they were very creative.",
        "There were no substantive comments on my graded homeworks, most of which were returned in the last couple of weeks in the quarter. I found myself wondering if the comments were automated, because I would receive comments that just read \">80 characters\" to mark a line with over 80 characters even though that line was from code that had been given to us and which I merely had not edited.",
        "I found this class to be significantly harder than 142 or 141. The lack of provided test cases made the homework assignments harder (although I understand the reasoning behind it), . Multiple homework assignments were released less than a week before the due date which made them difficult for me to complete on time during busy weeks."

        "I thought the most important topic was understanding the fundamentals of C.",
        "At the beginning of this course, Adam Shaw described the goal of this course as \"gaining computer fluency.\" And that's exactly what we gained. In this course, we learned our way around the terminal, Git, Linux, and more low\u2013level C programming. We also scratched the surface of how a CPU works under the hood, and how numbers are handled in bits.\n\nIn terms of the C, this means going back to the fundamentals with primitive types, variables, loops, recursion, structs, and pointers. We learned how to reconstruct binary trees, linked lists, and hash tables using pointers in linked data types.\n\nWe also did a bit of parallel programming, which was really fascinating.",
        "C Coding and computer savvy\u2013ness",

We covered data types, bits, bit representations (bytes, octal, hexadecimal), bit operations, arrays, pointers, pointer operations (dereferencing and addressing), pointer arithmetic, recursion and iteration for low\u2013level programming languages, strings in C (array of chars), string operations using string.h, the differences between the stack, heap, data segment, and code segment, memory management (malloc, free, valgrind), testing (criterion), structs, unions, trees, linked lists, sorting (bubble sort, insertion sort, count sort), function pointers, pthreads, files, stdin/stdout/stderr, and hashing / hash tables.\n\nBasically, I feel like we covered almost everything we need to know to be strong C programmers, and I feel very comfortable with high\u2013level C programming. We really focused on UNDERSTANDING how C programming works on the computer level rather than just writing code too, which I really appreciated (i.e. bit representations and operations, pointers, etc.).",

        "Lectures and labs were very helpful to my learning.",
        "Adam Shaw is a legendary instructor, it was always worthwhile going to every lecture and doing every lab. He always gives good motivation for every topic discussed, and approaches learning CS with a light\u2013hearted attitude, very much discouraging \"grade grubbing\". He really wants to see you succeed!\n\nNow labs in person were a bit of a different story. I went to the first 3, but every time, it consisted of me showing up to a room full of other students in other classes doing other work, with no TA in sight (I couldn't tell you what they looked like), and just doing the work assigned on a computer with no real organization.\n\nI imagine this is the reason why most students didn't show up to lab near the end. There was no reason to, since you'd gain just as much by doing the lab on your own time.",
        "The labs were somewhat helpful but they also deal with tangential topics like lldb that some might find unimportant.\nAssigments were most helpful to actually carry out many of the operations.",
        "Lectures and assignments were the most helpful. Labs were helpful for supporting work in the assignments.",
        "The lectures and assignments are the most helpful",
        "Labs were fun extra assignments. Lectures were always interesting thanks to Prof. Shaw.",
        "Lectures were very good. Adam Shaw was a fantastic lecturer and made them very informative, clear, concise, and digestible. I found homework to be very good at solidifying what I learned during lecture, and generally really enjoyed solving the problems they presented. They covered the material well, and were generally a very good length. I thought that the midterm quiz and final exam were very reasonable as well. Ed was helpful for keeping up with questions and general course information, but I don't think the TAs/Profs were as helpful on Ed this quarter vs. 141 and 142. Overall, I found the course to be very good and educational though.\n\nOffice Hours were very good, but maybe consider stacking up more office hours and TAs on days/hours prior to homeworks being due, as this is when demand got high. I understand that it's not the course staff's responsibility to be there and that it is the students' fault for not planning ahead, but inevitably, more students are going to show up to office hours the two days before the problem set is due vs. the two days after the problem set is assigned. Overall though, office hours were helpful and informative.\n\nMy first gripe is with homework grading. I understand why Prof. Shaw doesn't give us tests to run our homework code through, but if you're ALSO not going to share them with us afterwards, nor have the TAs leave feedback on our code after grading, then there is NO WAY we can learn from our mistakes...? When the autograders were published right before the final exam, I found issues in my code that the TAs didn't explain, and found myself trying to understand why I lost points on things the day before the exam. Plus, I lost points on homeworks for issues that had to do with the clarity of the homework instructions \u2013\u2013 not with an issue in my code. It took one line for me to fix a problem that cost me 8 points on the homework \u2013\u2013 and the only reason it wasn't there in the first place was because the homework instructions weren't clear about the requirements for inputs.\n\nI think a good middle ground for homework grading would be to have the autograder on Gradescope tell us how many points we lost, and then we can go back and correct it without knowing what the actual tests were \u2013\u2013 just knowing something isn't right in our code.\n\nMy second gripe was with labs. I think that labs were SOMETIMES informative and helpful. The first few labs and the lab on criterion and valgrind were good, but some of them were just kinda useless? I don't know why we had a lab on unions when we could just do unions in class. Similarly with the ncols labs. They were generally well structured, but it just felt like the Professors were trying to get us to learn more that they didn't cover in lecture. And for some reason, we had a labs EVERY week, including weeks 1 and 9? I understand that you want us to learn more, but like, no other department has NINE labs in a quarter, that's kind of absurd. I don't know why we're going to lab the day before our final problem set is due to learn a NEW subject which you said we need to learn because its going to be on the exam? And then, then labs are optional, but the Profs seem to get annoyed when we don't go during the midterm week or something...? and then tell us we need to go because the material is going to be on the exam? I don't know. Plus, then one of the labs was literally the homework, which was annoying.\n\nI think the labs are good, but don't have nine of them. Have six or seven, and cut out the lab subjects that were clearly put there because you couldn't think of anything else to teach us. I think the bytes/colorpatch lab was good, the pointers lab was extremely helpful, I liked the criterion and valgrind labs, and the reading P3/P6 lab was good, but it was annoying that we then needed it for the homework without prior notice.",
        "Lectures with Shaw were very engaging and stimulating, definitely contributed the most to my learning!",
        "The lectures were all very helpful in providing information about concepts and important methods to know. It was especially helpful to see examples of code and demonstrations of how they run. The labs provided additional ways to practice and tools to learn.",
        "Lectures did a great job introducing us to the concepts, and labs and assignments were good for helping us solidify our understanding of them.",
        "Lectures were excellent and the slides posted were incredibly valuable for studying. The labs were also very useful for gaining more experience in new concepts, and should be attended."

      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "While Adam Shaw is excellent, CMSC 14300 is a bit of a mixed\u2013bag compared to 14200 and 14100.\n\nOverall, it felt like 14300 was way less organized than 14200 and 14100. At times, it felt like Adam Shaw was pretty much doing everything aside from the grading. Responding to Ed posts, writing up the homework, writing up the labs... it all seemed to be from him alone, which made me wonder why the course didn't have more manpower dedicated to it like 14200 did.\n\nIn 14200 and 14100, your \"correctness\" grade on homework was based on given autograders. It's the same in 14300, but this time, students AREN'T given the autograder with which they'll be tested on. Instead, students have to come up with their own tests, encouraging us to become better programmers by anticipating edge\u2013case scenarios.\n\nAdmittedly, having to come up with bulletproof code that passes all my own tests was a lot of fun, and it did make me a much better programmer. But when we're tested on an autograder we have no access to, it's really discouraging receiving a really low grade despite all the work put into your own tests because there was a minor slip\u2013up between what the autograder expected and what you expected. Minor discrepancies like \"you needed to put a '\u2013' character, not a '_' character\" often causes the autograder's tests to fail, slapping the student in the face with a poor grade. Yes, the student can request a regrade, but there really needs to be a better way for students to feel comfortable in the work they submit like with 14100/14200.\n\nI also almost never received feedback on the quality of my code. I'm absolutely certain I did not submit perfectly written code throughout the quarter, yet a TA never provided any constructive feedback of my work on Gradescope.\n\nHomework was graded incredibly slowly. Beyond HW 1, it often took around 2\u2013weeks or more to receive a grade back. You can imagine how frustrating this was, when after 2 weeks you finally receive a grade back, and all you see is a series of autograder failures with no TA comments despite all your own self\u2013testing. (bearing in mind HW is 60% of the final grade!!!)\n\nThe textbook for this course is amazing. Highly encourage reading K&R, it's an excellent way to dive into C with prior programming experience.\n\nOverall, CMSC 14300 with Adam Shaw was great and the content was fascinating, but it's plagued by a lot of annoying logistical issues that stem from poor organization.\nI encourage the CS Department to keep working at improving the intro CS sequence, as they've done a really good job so far with 14100 and 14200, props to them.",

        "The motivations Adam Shaw provided for new topics were great. Unique ideas like \"a linked list is really just a unary tree\", or \"linked data structures intuitively feel wrapped together, but they're actually spread across memory\" gave a lot of intuition to what would otherwise be hard to grasp.\n\nSometimes there'd be weird metaphors, like \"you need to get 10 sumo wrestlers to the airport\" or \"should you order an Uber to send your iPhone to the airport?\", but they often got the idea across and gave plenty of laughter to everyone in the class. Really comfortable atmosphere.\n\nHis enthusiasm for CS in general emanates onto his students, it's great.",

        "Professor Shaw is a fantastic lecturer and presented the information very well. The content we covered was fascinating, and I really appreciated how Prof. Shaw made sure to focus on UNDERSTANDING the underlying C mechanisms rather than just getting good at C programming. Seriously, it was super interesting and helpful to be taught C this way. He is also super passionate about teaching, and gives great explanations and tangents that still solidify the material well. He also does a good job of tying in lectures to homework, labs, and exams. He was also generally pretty clear on expectations. The discussions and engagement that Prof. Shaw allowed for in\u2013class was also fantastic, and always made lectures exciting, fun, and active. I rarely checked the time to see when class was over because I truly enjoyed the time I spent in this class (a rare thing in undergraduate lecture courses).\n\nTruly, this course was one of my favorites that I have taken in the CS department. It was so so interesting and informative, made me a much better programmer, and helped me understand CS a lot more. Professor Shaw is also just an amazing lecturer and clearly understands the material so well in a way that helps me understand the material too.",

        "Adam Shaw often went on random asides. Sometimes it was really interesting, like his daughter being in AP CS and the comparisons you can make between Java, C, and Python. Other times it was \"you guys ever experience this? Anyways\u2013\" and we'd start going into actual content maybe 15 minutes after lecture began. Being more focused would be nice.\n\nA big one is showing up to lecture on time. Almost everyday, Adam Shaw would show up to lecture late by 4\u20135 minutes. This would often cause his lectures to cut short, which was a shame because he's such an incredible lecturer.\n\nThis is probably more of an opinion, but I really dislike Adam Shaw's coding style. It breaks many guidelines laid out in the CS Department C Style Guide, and IMO makes his code hard to read. This also bleeds into documentation. Unlike in 14100 and 14200, where every function needs a specifically formatted docstring, functions in 14300 just have general \"does this with this input\" documentation, lacking any real structure.",

        "I think Prof. Shaw was a bit disorganized in terms of overall course structure and maybe a bit rude when responding to issues that arose because of this disorganization. I.e. questions about grading mistakes was a big one. If you're not going to publish autograders until a few days before the exam, and going to take a few weeks to grade homework, I don't think it's fair to be upset with students who have concerns about the homework content, the grading schemes, or the grading of their individual homework, since these are all issues that they couldn't have known about until after we received grades and the autograders for the homework, which course staff took over a month to release. I understand that the final exam is in a day and you're busy, but so are we, and your business arises from your failure to prepare properly, not our failure to engage with the course. I generally tend to agree that it is usually the students' fault when things aren't organized or responded to well, but in this case, I do think it was a failure on the course staff.\n\nI also want to reiterate my comments about labs \u2013\u2013 make six or seven of them and pick the best ones. Nine labs is absurd, and lowkey gaslighting us into feeling like we need to go to all the labs because all of the material is going to be covered on the exam is annoying.\n\nLast thing I want to mention is that I think there should be more consistency between sections. I loved Prof. Shaw's lectures, but the other professor used lecture slides which went into a lot of depth about some things that Prof. Shaw didn't cover. It's nerve\u2013wracking prior to exams to feel like we missed some of the material that's going to be on the exam because we didn't have the same lecture slides / same lectures. The CS 141 and 142 courses did a good job of being consistent, which I think would be helpful for CS 143.",

Time consuming, but not hard.\n\nThe hardest part of the course was realizing how primitive C can be in the first few weeks. From Python, it's kinda jarring that there is no notion of \"string type\" or \"list type\" or \"class\"!\n\nFor this, I'd really recommend reading \"The C Programming Language\" by K&R. The authors do an excellent job reteaching you the fundamentals in the context of C, and at least one midterm question was an exercise taken directly from the textbook. I saw not many students reading the textbook, but you really should!\n\nThe min\u2013heap/max\u2013heap, binary trees, dictionaries, AVL trees, merge sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort all return from 14200/14100, so I'd make sure you know those well.\n\nAlso pointers.

Professor Chien was a good professor albeit seemingly unintentionally condescending at times towards questions that may seem obvious but very appreciative towards good questions. Professor Gunawi ran a flipped classroom model which was help in gaining an initial understanding but was hard for me to put into practice, but maybe it was just me. The projects were tough and really packed together even though there were only four. The labs were pretty useless except for exposing possible tools to use for the project.",

Homeworks were really important for the exams, but the projects tackled a different angle, asking us to ground this highly conceptual class in actual code. The projects were really novel and fun, and the optional labs were not required to enjoy them.",

        "Lectures went too fast, but were the most relevant to exams; the projects stuck the best in my mind, but least relevant to exams.",

        "I think both professors are very passionate about what they teach which makes lectures more enjoyable but it is still kinda hard to pay attention",

        "Recorded lectures",
        "The flipped classroom model in the 2nd half was amazing \u2013 it felt like I learned so much more and understood the material much more clearly. Professor Chien was also great, he felt like learning CS from a friendly uncle. Lectures were clearly explained and the class was very accessible.",
        "Second half of the quarter, having video lectures and creating true false questions to help us implement and test our understanding of the material. Also setting time after class to answer any questions about the lectures or the T/F questions.",
        "Chien's anecdotes about the industry during the first half of the quarter were what kept me engaged in class, since I already knew most of the material. Gunawi's pacing was impeccable throughout the second quarter, and the video lectures themselves were surprisingly entertaining.",
        "Both lecturers were very informative and helpful. I enjoyed how both of them was structured with one being flipped and the other being normal slides.",
        "Prof. Gunawi's use of a flipped classroom approach in the second half of the course was excellent",
        "I would say having slides available on Canvas to review before and after lecture was most helpful.",
        "Professor Chien's lectures had a good mix of technical knowledge and also it's practical implications which I liked.\n\nProfessor Gunawi did a hybrid version where we'd have to watch lectures prior to actual class. This was very time\u2013consuming, but I actually liked it because you can absorb material at your own pace and then get small things clarified in class",
        "Both professors are fantastic lecturers.",
        "Haryadi's flipped classroom",
        "Professor Chien had very clear lecture slides, but also amazing insights not given on the slides.\nProfessor Haryadi's lecture videos were always very informative, and the quizzes help a lot with contextualizing that information.",
        "Professor Gunawi's tests were awesome. Please never change the flipped\u2013classroom format. It was very helpful for the slides to have problems similar to the exams and the massive quantity of TF questions was very helpful.",

The projects felt a bit isolated from what we were learning in class, but they were nonetheless helpful for me to get some more tangible practice with C and assembly language. Homeworks were helpful and felt like they went more hand in hand with the lectures and exams.",

Homework assignments reinforced class material pretty well and were good preparation for the exams. The projects tended to be pretty interesting but felt a bit disconnected from the course material \u2013\u2013 e.g. we would spend a week talking about processes and threads and concurrency, and the shell project that ostensibly would give us practice with this course material was really just a big string parsing and file management exercise. The projects did make me better at organizing my code, though, since unlike CMSC 152 there was no boilerplate given for the projects \u2013\u2013 just a blank .c file and instructions for what we were supposed to make it do.",

Professor Gunawi's lectures were online, and then we used class time to test that knowledge. Hated that, but I know some people preferred it.

I honestly did not think Chien was a great lecturer\u2013 he wasn't necessarily bad, but I didn't really understand a lot of the stuff he talked about until I read the textbook. Note that the TEXTBOOK is helpful for the first half of the course and the ONLINE LECTURES are helpful for the second half.",

Sometimes it took me two listens of a lecture (using the videos) to really understand the material, but that wasn't possible with live lectures. Even just recording his live lectures and uploading them would be more helpful than only offering live lectures. It made it much harder to understand material which is already hard to understand.",
        "I was surprised that we finished all of the course material before Thanksgiving. I feel like Prof. Chien had to speed through lecture slides to cover all the material he had to (and it could sometimes be difficult to follow everything at that speed), but then at the end of the quarter we had more than a full week without class. It was nice, I guess, to be finished with the CS final exam before the actual exam week, but it was a bit strange.",

Labs and projects were quite frequent (usually we had work due every class), spanned many different formats/setups/languages, and touched upon HCI topics covered in class.",

        "Homework assignments were fun and creative, the projects helped us apply the concepts we learned over the course of lectures, and the lectures were interesting",
        "The projects/hws forced us to think like HCI designers as they were evaluated based on the usability and design quality of our interfaces. Lectures were interesting but mostly only scratched the surface of a very broad field.",
        "The lectures presented the ideas and concepts that we were expected to implement/take into consideration as we designed and/or coded our homeworks and projects. The lectures did not teach any technical skills though, you were expected to have the skills to implement what we were learning already or be able to teach yourself.",

Though the TAs were very nice, the whole helpdesk set up made the teaching team feel a lot more distant.",

The projects and homeworks were usually quite open ended in the sense that we were given a goal, but it was up to us how we implemented that goal.

        "Standards for success on assignments could often be extremely confusing and not well communicated. Feedback after the assignment was turned in was fairly detailed and informative, which I appreciated. But there was often no way to know what graders would be looking for until after the assignment was already turned in, leading to a large and confusing range of grades across assignments.",
        "More time to work on the projects, and more guidance with the first few homework assignments as the first ones felt a bit difficult since they were mostly design based when we didn't have a full grasp over what would good design look like.",

        "I wish the assignments were modified to be not as technically challenging or that there were longer timelines for each assignment. Almost every new assignment/project utilized a different language/program and there were very short deadlines between these assignments. This class is primarily about design, so it was frustrating that I could not put forth my best creative work because I spent so much time looking at documentation trying to figure out a new library/language/program or being limited by my lack of technical knowledge.",
        "None that I can think of.",
        "Prof. Lopes has his way of doing things and his expectations can sometimes be overwhelming. For example, for project 1, trying to schedule with four other teams over one weekend was just too much. Overall, I felt like for a given assignment, there were a lot of moving pieces to constantly keep track of. I think clearer expectations for projects (maybe providing a rubric) would be helpful.",
        "The really fast in\u2013class exercises we did could be a bit stressful given how short of a time we had for each one. I think they could still be valuable, but a few minutes was usually not enough time for me to demonstrate my best ideas.",
        "I personally feel like the ping pong project (final project) was very unfair. The code wouldn't run for Macs with M1 chips. The project was assigned before Thanksgiving break and was due the Wednesday of the returning week. Professor Lopes expected us to work on the project over break, which was fine for those of us with Intel chips, but those with M1 chips who were out of town could not work on the CSIL computers. They basically had to finish the project in 3 days. Overhauling this could drastically reduce student stress.\n\nProfessor Lopes was also very inflexible to students requesting extensions. I know at least one person with an M1 chip who was not able to get an extension on the ping pong project (due to being out of town for Thanksgiving break).",

Essentially I'd say this class is more time\u2013consuming than hard.",

A lot of the assignments are JavaScript or Python\u2013based with a short turn\u2013around time, but I think the difficulty level is still manageable if you don't have a lot of programming experience. For project 2, Jas' Unity tutorial is fantastic. Just start early on everything and you'll be fine.",
        "This was my first cs elective after the 150's. The homework and project assignments cover a really large range, so we work with a pretty broad range of programming languages and softwares. Technically, it's helpful if you have a background in Python, Javascript, AND C#. You are expected to have technical skills to implement a wide range of designs or you have to be able to teach yourself very quickly.",
        "As a 3rd year CS student, not too difficult (I also had prior Unity experience, which I think other students struggled to pick up on such a short time frame). Overall not too bad if you're comfortable learning new languages quickly.",

        "This class, if you have taken no other CS classes out of CS154, may be a bit difficult. I think it is meant for students who already have some decent exposure to different technologies ie Unity, Javascript, etc. I took this class as a 4th year and felt very prepared and perfectly challenged throughout the entire course."

      "Describe how aspects of this course (lectures, discussions, labs, assignments, etc.) contributed to your learning.": [
        "While some of the lectures were interesting, most of them were not as useful and it would be nice if they could make have a clear rubric on what they would like to see in our assignments.",
        "Lectures were super interesting and engaging, with plenty of cool video examples of the concepts being discussed. Short homework assignments concretized lecture topics.",
        "While Professor Nakagaki and the TAs were very nice and helpful, I felt like the curriculum overall was very badly designed. It was not what I expected at all. This can't be blamed on Nakagaki since the slides are entirely designed by the other professor, Pedro. I felt like there was no meaningful order, it was just a seemingly very sporadic and illogical sample of random areas related to human\u2013computer interaction, based on the professor\u2019s personal interests. It was not a comprehensive introduction to HCI at all. Even worse, I felt like the content of every lecture was shallow enough that I can just read a random Google search article or watch a 15 minute Youtube video and learn more. A lot of the examples of research given were based in Nakagaki and Pedro\u2019s labs, which is nice, but I would\u2019ve appreciated a broader perspective.\n\nWe would also sometimes spend a lot of time going into detail on topics that did not feel very relevant. For example, in a lecture about UI in VR, we spent way too much time going into detail about how the human eye and eyesight worked (like, how light rays refract and the different types of cells in the eye). There were two lectures on prototyping which could\u2019ve been covered in 30 minutes and some helpful reading assignments. And why is prototyping even chosen for human\u2013computer interaction? I understand that prototyping is necessary for user studies, but do we really need to go into such detail on it? We also spent one lecture on project 1 feedback, but this feedback could\u2019ve just been given online.\n\nI expected readings on important HCI areas, papers or theory, but there were none. I\u2019m very confused about this aspect of the course, since in my experience, textbooks and papers are integral parts of any STEM course, and I usually learn a lot from those. Not sure why the course designer could not be bothered to assign at least some reading.\n\nFurthermore, the grading for homeworks was very unclear. I know that since this is a design\u2013focused class it's hard to specify what you are looking for in the project without giving away the answer, but it was just so vague. Something like a grading rubric would\u2019ve been very helpful.\n\nThe projects did not feel particularly helpful or relevant to human\u2013computer interaction. It felt very random too. Project 1 was a user study, and it was particularly unfair since different groups were assigned different user studies, and some studies were just harder to achieve a higher grade on. Based on what topic you are assigned, you do your project using a simple javascript web\u2013app, or spend hours trying to learn Swift and get the Xcode environment to work. The instructions were very vague.\n\nProject 2 was a VR diving game, and it felt like a lot of the time was wasted on setting up the equipment and just regular programming or learning C# in Unity instead of human\u2013computer interaction. The choice of a 3D VR game Unity is also rather dubious, since it probably gives the least applicable skills. Most of us don\u2019t have a $300 VR headset, and unless you\u2019re going into VR game design, it's not clear how we can use the skills learned on other things. Yes, we did learn UI design skills, but this could\u2019ve been done with designing a website or a more useful web\u2013app without wasting hours on busy work on the Oculus.\n\nProject 3 was called \u201ceyes free pong\u201d, where you make a pong game that you play without eyes. Again, since there was only one lecture on accessibility, I\u2019m not sure why the project should be on this. Again, the instructions were very vague and confusing. It was unclear what parts of the starter code should be modified and what parts shouldn\u2019t. Again, the project was much easier or harder based on your computer hardware, making it very unfair. The starter code contained a Google speech\u2013to\u2013text\u2013API that was VERY laggy and sometimes would just not work, rendering it impossible to test your code. I\u2019m not sure why the instructor did not take this into consideration and use an offline API in the starter code. Also, they seem to think that if your computer can\u2019t run the libraries they used, then you should just go to CSIL, not considering that if everyone goes to CSIL for a speech\u2013to\u2013text recognition project and sits side by side shouts at their computer, the background would be very loud and the program would fail.\n\nAlso, my group was assigned \u201ceyes free emojis\u201d, for project 1, so it just felt like a lot of this course was about \u201ceyes free\u201d which is again, very random and narrow considering the entire field of human\u2013computer interaction.",
        "Basic HW assignments were nice, but projects were less organized than preferable, lots of wasted time understanding things that were not pertinent to the topics being taught.",
        "The lectures were great at communicating design principles and considerations. In class activities were a mixed bag, some of them were very helpful for better understanding what was discussed in class, such as the paper prototyping, but more than one felt like an excuse to use a google form to take attendance. The homework gave us an interesting way to experiment with those principles. The first project was a great way to introduce us to user study design. The second project was great at getting us to think about design principles in prototyping, but was not effective as a way to get us to think about refining that prototype in actual implementation, which I suspect was one of its main goals.\nThe feedback on assignments was the most consistently helpful I've had in any course in the University, it was detailed in explaining both what worked well and where we could improve in future assignments.",

        "SUPER COOL COURSE",
        "Although you are in Ken Nakagaki\u2019s section, you should know that everything is going to be micromanaged by Pedro. It seemed like Professor Nakagaki had no say in how the course was designed, on assignments, or extensions. Speaking of Pedro, I don\u2019t know how good of a lecturer he is, but he is definitely very strange and unreasonable. Someone from his other class said he is \u201ca little bit crazy\u201d. First, he refuses to use a Ed/Canvas/discussion forum and insists that everything be done through email, meaning that students can\u2019t see the questions of other students, and students can\u2019t help each other. Second, he is extremely disconnected from reality. When I emailed him about unfairness in the project design, he said that if I want to code on my laptop, I should buy an architecture that is more widely supported :) He was rather rude and condescending in his emails to me. It seems like his ego is getting in the way of actually helping students. Also he gave extensions to some students but said \u201cno extensions, that\u2019s unfair to other students\u201d to others. Overall a very confusing person to deal with.\n\nHe seems to think that forcing students to remain on campus and go to CSIL during thanksgiving break is an acceptable method of completing the project, failing to consider that 1) thanksgiving break is break 2) students literally are flying home to their families 3) CSIL is actually closed from Thursday to Sunday. Also, I know that he wanted the course to be fun with the \u201cdiver expo\u201d and the \u201cpong tournament\u201d, but is this really what provides the best learning outcome/ the best use of class time? It\u2019s nice when instructors make the course fun, but this should not be done at the cost of actual learning. I can\u2019t help but wonder, is he really helping his students, or just designing a class that he thinks is cool and quirky and \u2018fun\u2019 (it would be more cool if it is fair)?\n\nAlso, Ken\u2019s class had a Slack channel, and when someone asked for an extension on project 3 (and received a lot of agreement from other students), his message just got deleted from the channel by the TA. This is a bit sketchy, to say the least.",
        "I thought the grading of projects and assignments was pretty arbitrary. The TA's are mostly responsible for grading it seems like and the thing about this class is that it can be very subjective. You can do everything they tell you to do for the assignment but they can always take off points for whatever they feel like. Also, they did not give us enough time to finish the final project (in fact we were given three days) and seemed to be unwilling to budge on the deadline even if it was unreasonable. Students with M1 macs may want to stay clear of this course because there is a lack of support for M1's for a lot of the libraries and software used in this class.",

        "The second project (VR diver) wasn't structured very well. We repeatedly ran into issues that objects in VR did not seem to appear in the same locations as in Unity 3D. This led to times where we would need to rebuild and restart the VR environment dozens of times just to position an object on screen. Due to the slow process of rebuilding the environment, this could mean hours of time testing the position before we could even check if a feature worked. Because of this, rather than focusing on the actual iterative design of the UI, the project mainly became about desperately trying to get each UI element we designed to actually be visible. Additionally, we regularly ran into issues with the Oculi, the hand tracking often couldn't handle having two hands near each other, which caused issues if you wanted to attach any UI elements to the hand. I think reducing the number of elements necessary in the design (for instance, saying that you need to design at least 8 of the 10 elements), giving more time, or having the UI design be outside of VR would have helped.\n\nThe lectures at times felt like they went a bit off track when they discussed the professors' lab work. I think we saw the same demo video four or five different times, and at times it didn't feel as though they were contributing much to the class. Although I think it made sense to include these in the slides, it would have been better to spend less time talking about them and rewatching the videos.",

        "Lectures were cool! Prof. Sebo never just talked at us for 80 minutes, there was always an interactive exercise to make sure we actually had a concrete understanding of what was going on. Prof. Sebo makes excellent slides. Labs helped us gain hands\u2013on experience with the robots, and the projects had us actually apply that knowledge. I will note that we covered many topics in the lectures and only used a few of them in the projects, but I understand that this was necessary in order to do substantial programming projects rather than lots of weekly exercises.",
        "The labs and projects make up the entirety of the work of the course and they really pair so well with the lectures. You are taught a concept in the lectures, and then implement it in the labs and/or projects.",

      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "I think that this class could be really good, extremely well, but currently there are some logistic problems that are just unrealistic. What I know that a lot of students were mentioning was how much time the class took, but not because of coding, but just having to do tedious debugging. Some type of guide over this would have helped a lot. I understand that one of the purposes of letting students figure it out is that this is a vital part of robotics programming, I get it, but there were some PHD level students in _robotics_ that were in our class as well. It is unfair whenever they get to debug in a couple hours, and the rest of us who are truly new to robotics have to do more. I would say roughly 30\u201340% of time to complete project is coding/reasoning, the rest is debugging or seeing how robot reacts in real life condition and tweaking numbers/constants until it works.",
        "I worked so so soooo much in this course (it was completely my choice) and it was completely worth it. Very fulfilling class, very hands\u2013on, super exciting stuff. Everyone should try to take this course. You don't have to be a CS major and super awesome at programming or anything like that to be successful. Just curious and motivated and interested in robotics.",
        "Prof. Sebo is great! She and the course staff were supportive through robot malfunctions, debugging sessions, and pivots in project scope. I would absolutely recommend taking a class of hers if you get the chance. Additionally, I appreciated the Careers in Robotics panel. This course is project\u2013based, so expect to spend a good amount of time on the projects, but I did not mind this.",
        "This was one of the coolest classes I've ever taken at UChicago. It is so well organized and so fun. It is incredibly difficult at times though, but never unmanageable.",
        "Probably one of my favorite CS classes ever."
      ],
      "Thinking about your time in the class, what aspect of the instructor's teaching contributed most to your learning?": [
        "I would say the step by step lectures were very engaging. Adding an in class, partnered activity with an answer at the end was also very useful in helping me understand and retain information.",
        "I would say that whenever lectures introduced a topic we hadn't covered about and included some examples (even if they were simple) over the algorithm that we would cover in more detail over the project was extremely helpful.",
        "Lectures were really interesting and talking to Sarah after class to clarify stuff that we learned about was always super helpful. Also, it was great to get advice from her about what direction my partner and I were taking for our project.",
        "The lectures were great and taught us well. Prof. Sebo excellently arranged the course website to clearly show the syllabus, project expectations, and class material.",
        "The professor lectures incredibly well and made use of group assignments within lectures quite often, which made sure all of the students understood the material being taught.",
        "Walking through concepts and class exercises was most helpful in learning the concepts for the upcoming project.",
        "Sarah was super nice and was a great lecturer. Used a lot of hands\u2013on practice in class to help learning."
      ],
      "What could the instructor modify to help you learn more?": [
        "As I briefly mentioned, having some type of debugging guide or classes being dedicated to replicate some of the most common bug issues found and how to fix would be aboslutely invaluable to this class.",
        "This is a hands on class, so most of the learning happened during the labs; the lecture slides weren't that helpful, but this is expected given that this is not a robotics theory course.",
        "For one of the projects, I was definitely held back by my partner, who was not contributing much at all. Maybe in the future it would be nice to let students stick with the same partner from a previous project if they work well together? Or there could be a \"partner survey\" sent out that can help people pick partners with the same schedule, work style & work ethic.",

This class was very difficult, not because the code is hard to pick up (this is actually the easy part), but as I mentioned the amount of tedious debugging that has to be done in order for your project to be successful is the most tedious I've experienced thus far (I'm a 4th year).",

        "Difficult only because of hardware and setup issues, but it was so rewarding. I only have 2 classes left to complete my CS major.",
        "Robots are occasionally frustrating because they will break, but it's not all that different from any other programming course. The projects do take work, but I found this work reasonable, and actually liked working on the projects. If you can, try to pick reputable teammates for group projects.",
        "This class is incredibly difficult at times. If you procrastinate in this class, you are not going to have a wonderful time. If you start early, and arent afraid to ask for help, this class is one of the most rewarding classes you can take here.",
        "Programming was not that challenging as a CS major, but working with hardware was very difficult",
        "Class is definitely time consuming and the concepts can be difficult. The difficulty is mitigated in that all the algos are applied in code so the math is light. Highly recommend the class though!"

The final project was not too bad and relatively interesting and engaging. The final was horrific, so hard. No one turned it in before the time was up, but it was heavily curved/nicely graded.",

        "textbook and problem sets were very helpful",
        "Office hours with TAs were life savers, lectures were very dull and didn\u2019t rely on slides or any types of notes that we could take and later study by ourselves. The instructor just assumed that we read the textbook by ourselves and went through examples during class.",

        "weekly assignments which were very repetitive and essentially just implementing rules from the book tediously",

        "EDstem was extremely helpful. Professors and TAs were extremely available there.",
        "lectures are kind of hard to follow, lowkey a big flaw in the class is you essentially don't really need to understand the theory to do all the assignments given you can figure out the patterns from there and for me the theory was sort of unnecessary / convoluted. especially coming off algos it was kind of frustrating to have proofs that all have sort of underwhelming / obvious solutions (things are well typed). Nothing against prof rand, he tried his best but I think it's just sort of a disconnect between the work you do and lectures"

        "Not the most interesting content ngl",
        "So, for this course I wanted to give a more in\u2013depth comment as to *why* I am not rating it highly. I think that the ideas in the course are interesting, in fact I think that my ability to code has definitely gotten better (I think coding a parse is quite tedious, but I do think that it makes you think about your code and if you don't, then you can just get really bogged down and spiral down into a series of dumb coding problems). However, I think that due to this being the first iteration of the class, the Professor was a bit hesitant and/or assumed a bit with regards to what student's prior knowledge was. Not only that, but I felt that towards the start of the quarter, the Professor was very unsure in how to deliver the content \u2013 There was hesitancy/general view of nervousness whenever it came to the questions presented, and often answers were far to in\u2013depth to what was relevant in the class. It's interesting to note, there were a couple students in the class that were quite intelligent, and definitely knew more about the topic then the rest of us (I remember raising our hands a couple times if we didn't understand the topic and everyone *but* them raised their hand). The class kind of spiraled into a situation where only they would talk, and other people would not, as a result a lot of people were completely lost and only focused on one thing: making sure the homework autograder would get a good grade (and in general, it just felt like people even stopped coming to class and would only want to get the A on the homework since that was all that they wanted out of the class).",
        "The course was definitely approachable for a programming languages and systems course. I would recommend it to anyone majoring in CS.",
        "In my experience, this was the worse computer science course that I have taken at UChicago. The lectures were about programming language theory but the weekly assignments were all in OCaml, while all exams were about theory. That way, we didn\u2019t have any practice problems or past exams made by the instructor and TAs to study for any written exams, which is why the scores for the quiz and final were so low. I just hoped that there would be more effort into preparing original material for the students as opposed to always saying that Benjamin Pierce or other researchers are good resources for this class.",
        "Lectures were quite confusing, and finding the proper information from the textbook about course content was very challenging.",
        "This was my least favorite class offered in the CS department. Professor Rand gave very confusing and dry lectures. The class was disorganized. The work was graded very harshly and with little relevant feedback. The assignments were very repetitive and most of it conferred no educational benefit. I don't know why we need to implement a parser 10 zillion times.\n\nI recommended to anyone interested in Programming Languages that they wait until another professor comes around to teach it, e.g. Shaw.",
        "not too bad work wise but lectures always felt sort of tedious but I guess that's just programming languages as a concept rather than the professor",

        "Not assume that everyone in the class is a genius",
        "Maybe having notes be available online and slowing down during lectures to allow us more time to write notes down.",
        "I think one improvement would just be teaching with more examples and with less formal language. I found it a bit hard to stay focused when I did not immediately understand many of the terms used, but then later when I read the book I was able to understand the material because I could digest it slower. I think in a lecture setting it's okay to sacrifice formality for understandability, especially when the textbook already contains all of the rigor behind the ideas anyways.",

        "Lectures were the basis of the material, textbook helped us reinforce what we learned, and then the labs were supposed to help us get a hands\u2013on application of the material we learned.",
        "Lectures were very interesting and relevant for exams, but almost completely detached from the labs (which were 60% of the total grade).\n\nLab sessions didn't have any new material, they were just a time to work on the labs with the TAs present for questions.",

        "This was a very disorganized course. We didn't get any grades/feedback until the eighth week of classes, which is especially problematic given that the labs (worth 60% of our final grade) build on top of each other. If that wasn't enough, the TAs made an error in grading out first lab, so we still don't have these grades by ninth week. I sent an email asking when to expect them to come out, and I have not gotten a response.\n\nI'd say about half the class has dropped out of this course by now. The material is pretty difficult and the labs are lengthy and annoying. This class was worse than CS 154. I would not recommend taking it.",
        "The content and labs were super interesting and I really enjoyed this class, however it was extremely poorly structured, with the rubrics by which labs would be tested unclear, and both the instructions for the lab and the ta's understanding of the lab was often confusing and contradictory. Additionally the tester file and the exemplar simulator which we used to test the labs spontaneously broke for multiple people. This class had the highest dropout rate out of any class I have been in, but was genuinely pretty fun.",
        "The labs build on each other, but grades and feedback came out way after the next lab was due. So, you can't adjust your work to account for mistakes.",
        "TAs are bad (you are supposed to work 15 hours a week right??????). Grading is unclear. Lecture is OK but may not be closely related to exams and assignments. No staff seems to care about this course. The first assignment got graded during the 7th week (hilarious). And TAs don't even think they are doing anything wrong. They never reply to Ed discussion messages on time (and none of the few replies had been helpful).",
        "Even though the course material is interesting and the professor is really knowledgeable and helpful, the organization of labs was very disappointing. Labs had the majority of the grade, but none of them were graded until week 7, by which point we had submitted three labs that built on each other (so if something is wrong in the first one, it would impact later labs and we wouldn't know how). The TA's weren't very responsive, especially when asked about grading and would show up late to office hours at the times I went. The TA's would also give wrong answers for the labs, so a lot of people reached a point where they just didn't care about the class anymore and would do whatever because we weren't given any correct answers or grades for the majority of the quarter.",
        "The labs themselves take a LOT of time and should be started quite early",
        "I love the material, so I'm a bit biased. However, this class was very unorganized and disconnected. This made it very difficult for honestly dumb reasons (sometimes I spent hours debugging their reference simulator, which had errors in it, before I could even begin testing my own code)\n\nalso, for a course where the labs build off of each other, it was a bit ridiculous that we received our grades over a month after we submitted assignments.",
        "I think there's a serious issue with how the course is organized, and it has to do with the labs.\n\nThere are 4 labs, centered around building up a simulator of an ARM microprocessor and implementing features like caching, branch prediction, and pipelining that you learn about in lecture. They're cumulative and worth 60% of the total grade in the class. The way you're graded in the labs is by comparing the step\u2013by\u2013step output of your simulator with a reference simulator. Both their internal states must match exactly, at every point in time.\n\nThe issue is that the reference simulator is a complete black box, you are provided zero insight into its design, and the exact behavioral specifications of the reference simulator are unclear and ambiguous in the lab descriptions.\n\nWhenever you do run into an issue, it's almost never because you misunderstand the material or included a bug in your code\u2013\u2013it's because you made a different design assumption (that was not mentioned in the lab document) about the exact timing of certain actions. Because the simulation routine is quite complicated and there are many different abstract layers to simulate, it's often unclear exactly where your simulator differs from the reference, just that it somehow leads to a different state at X point in time. The stringent requirements to exactly match the reference simulator means that this difference is actually incredibly important, and you will be penalized, often quite heavily, on any mismatch. You basically have to puzzle out what is expected of you by trying to guess what design assumptions and specifications went into the reference simulator.\n\nThe cherry on top is that the reference simulator itself has bugs/inconsistent behavior in it, and you have to parse out what is a bug and what is expected behavior based off specifications you don't have.\n\nI want to preface this by saying I'm someone who loved 154, and this course is ostensibly 154++. The lectures were amazing and the material is incredibly interesting, but given the labs and grading system, I don't think you should take this course as it currently stands. It's more frustrating than educational, and the vast majority of your time will be spent banging your head against a black box instead of learning the material.",
        "I don't think Professor Chong normally teaches this course. He taught lectures well, and his interest/passion was evident, making going to class great! However, the class itself was very badly organized. Lectures were interesting, but the framing between topics was just not clear. Our labs, which built upon each other, were not graded for weeks. The students understood more about the labs than the TAs or Professor, and had to fix the testing file ourselves. Throughout the first half of the quarter, our questions on Ed Discussion were not answered by anyone except other students. I was very interested in computer architecture going into this course, but the organization and structure of the class made it hard to enjoy learning.",
        "It was difficult to understand the behavior of the reference simulator we were given for debugging purposes.",
        "Heavily lab\u2013based, and questionably graded.",
        "All of the labs use code from previous labs, but there are multiple hidden test cases that students don't see. Failing these cases doesn't help students identify issues in their code or understanding to improve for the next labs.",
        "I really like the content of the class and it has lots of potential, but its organization is disappointing. Professor Chong is clearly knowledgable about the subject, which is shown through the lectures, but everything else falls short. The labs were unclear in their implementations and buggy, but when students would ask for help on Ed, it was always students responding to students. Further, feedback/grades on labs came so late that you weren't able to fix mistakes you made on earlier ones. There were no materials to prepare for exams (no practice problems or practice psets), and the connections to the textbook were light. Overall, it's hard to recommend this class even though the content was interesting since there was very little structure.",
        "The class is essentially comprised of 6 grades (4 labs, a midterm, and a final) and we received our first lab back in essentially eighth week, which was fun.",
        "Make sure to put extra time into labs early on because they build on eachother. Write your own tests for labs because the test suite given doesn't cover what you will be graded on.",
        "Ok here's the thing about this course. The lectures? Worthwhile and engaging. The things they wanted us to implement in our labs? Reinforced what we were talking about and definitely helped me understand it. The actual grading and expectations for the labs? Ugghh.\n\nThere are 4 labs: make a single cycle processor, make it pipelined, add branch prediction, add cache behavior. Each one builds on the last. But the grading is done against a reference simulator. We're expected to match the ref's behavior cycle\u2013for\u2013cycle. Which is a pain, but okay, fair. But the reference simulator is a black box, and when you're not matching it, it's hard to know if that's a bug in your code or if there's something you didn't understand\u2013\u2013especially because we're writing a serial simulation of a parallel pipeline, so some \"this happens now\" things need to be delayed until the end of the cycle. It encourages throwing stuff at the wall to see if it sticks. And for lab4, the ref sim is just actually buggy and inconsistent. Don't know why. TAs acknowledged as much, so that's great. Final issue was grading and feedback. Lab 1 grades were released a few days before lab3 and the rest were even later. No actual feedback or explanation of what might be wrong. Also responses to questions on Ed were slow, which made it that much harder to know what the simulator was doing or how it's supposed to work.\n\nNow, given all that you might expect me to hate the course. But I enjoyed it. The stuff we're actually learning in lectures and doing in labs is interesting and I had fun working on it. The massive issues were course administration, not content or work per se. It's a good class held back by bad structure."

In principle this system is understandable since it puts pressure on you to make sure everything is done right and cleanly. However, in practice it's an absolute disaster when the testing code doesn't work and when you get your first lab back at the end of 7th week when you have already submitted 3 out of the 4 labs (so it's too late to fix mistakes)."

The only way to avoid this is to ask many clarifying questions on Ed or go to office hours. This wouldn't have been an issue if grading was more lenient with respect to the student's interpretation of the question.\n\nAnother difficulty of the course is that the homework assignments are written by the TAs, whereas the exams are written by the Professor. This causes a bit of a disconnect between the homework and the exams. It would be better if the Professor released some study guide or sample questions.",

It is well organized and well taught.\n\nThe weekly programming assignments were challenging, but never seemed unreasonable.\nThe weekly problem sets also were never unreasonable.\n\nProfessor Chugh coded live during lectures, which I felt was a good decision. Because of this, the pace of the course was always natural.\n\nOne of my biggest pluses of this course is that the grading was always reasonable. I have taken CS courses in the past where grading was overly result\u2013based and inflexible so often one small mistake can cost you a large portion of the grade. However, in this course, the TAs always graded work fairly and in a way that reflected the project more realistically.\n\nThis isn't to say that the course was not challenging. It was, but the fact that it was well\u2013run and well\u2013taught made it enjoyable nonetheless, which is what I wanted to highlight.",

        "It is inconceivable how this is a 200\u2013level computer science course. The material is taught at the level of a high school class. The class lacks the mathematical depth and detail expected of a college\u2013level computer science course. The lack in mathematical depth makes the material seem much more arbitrary and unintuitive in nature, hindering student understanding.\n\nThe professor herself lacks understanding the material and refuses to discuss mathematical concepts necessary to actually understand quantum computing. This results in a stark chasm between the primitve level of in\u2013class instruction and the much more sophisticated level of knowledge expected by the TA's. Because students do not actually learn the material in class, they are lost when seeking help from the TAs.\n\nHomework assignments contain pointless questions that seem to be copies from old questions on her EdX course and that do not assess understanding of the material. Programming assignments are incredibly poorly designed and documented such that students must waste hours trying to discern the parameters and specifications of an assignment (e.g. expected input/output types, behaviors) instead of meaningful programming.\n\nThis course needs to be completely scratched, re\u2013designed from the ground\u2013up, and taught by a more knowledgable professor.",
        "No additional comments to those above.",
        "Not a very high workload, so if that's all you care about, register.\n\nThis class could have been so much more exciting. Instead, the only things I could think about were how I showed up to lab, but the lab wasn't actually read for us to do, so I wasted an hour and a half every week. Every time you learn some conceptualization method for qubits, you immediately have to tear it down because it's not actually correct, and you don't learn that for another two weeks, but it's good enough for the time being. Most of the homework was fine, but there was no need for questions that were actively trying to trick us. If you don't know advanced linear algebra, you simply cannot complete some of the labs. I could go on. Why are we back to writing code by hand on exams?\n\nTake all of this with a grain of salt. Plenty of people enjoyed this class, and most ended with a decent grade."

        "The labs were a bit of a mess, it seems like the TAs created them unsupervised so I think it would be better if the instructor reviewed the labs and the autograder before releasing it. And making sure that the writeup includes all information in a clear and organized way. It looked like the writeups were sloppily modified from a previous version, and sometimes it was hard to tell what I was actually supposed to do based on the poorly organized info.",
        "Honestly, I feel like this is it, no more modification to the content in the class. BUT, the assingment in terms of Auto\u2013grading is in need of a LOT of revision. I cannot communicate enough, the autograder made the assingment take much longer to do 2 specific labs than what was actually required. The concepts were completely fine, but in order to test the code we would run autograder and not get any output back. I supsect this is becuase the output was instructor code that would just give out the answer immediately, but there could be better ways to have that.\nTLDR: Autograder revision would make an amazing Quality of Life upgrade to this course with already amazing foundations."

        "Honestly, the class time itself didn't help much for the projects. The videos and learning from the project itself was the main part of it all.",
        "The lecture videos + the Q/A in class I thought was useful in making sure that you understood more of the details of each topic. I thought the projects were useful in giving hands\u2013on experience and really improving intuition for some of the concepts.",
        "This course had a flipped classroom format where students would watch prerecorded lectures and do True/False questions during class time.\n\nSome parts of the Pintos projects required implementing the design logic we learnt in the lecture videos, but the vast majority of the projects simply require writing and debugging a substantial amount of C code.",
        "Most learning took place via recorded lectures on Panopto. Lectures were there mainly to go over a set of questions which Prof Gunawi had prepared as a knowledge check. Projects were there to give us extensive experience implementing parts of an Operating System. The course layout was overall very good, but it's definitely one of the most difficult and time\u2013intensive CS classes out there.",
        "the prerecorded videos were super informative, and the quizzes in class session were great at reinforcing what we had learnt. The projects were a great way to test our knowledge.",
        "The lectures make sense and are good for the T/F and exams but the projects are a beast of their own.",
        "Projects were brutal. I have never dedicated so much time to a course, or computer science at all, within the time of a quarter.",
        "The videos and multiple choices are super helpful!",
        "Flipped classroom lectures and T/F question discussions were very helpful in learning the content, as it was always easy to review and make sure that I understood the topics well. The projects help somewhat with the content understanding when they are related, but they are mostly there to make you a MUCH better programmer. Systems programming is HARD and highly detail oriented, and the projects will skyrocket your capabilities if you put in the time and effort.",
        "Flipped classroom\u2014lecture videos were generally good, and classes were for answering questions on the videos. Projects took up the most time but helped to reinforce concepts.",
        "The videos were super helpful for exam prep, while the T/F were covered really well during classes, where you could get additional explanations for your T/F questions. To study for exams, just rewatch every video, redo all of the practice questions he goes over in the videos until you completely understand them, and memorize the T/F.\nTA office hours are the best way to receive assistance on the projects, and people respond on ED in a pretty timely manner if you have a question.",
        "The primary way information was conveyed via pre\u2013recorded lectures and then we could test our knowledge with T/F home assignments that we did along with those videos. In class we would check and very briefly discuss them. And of course we also learned through doing and actually implemented timer interrupts, priority scheduling, *virtual memory*, and a file system!",
        "Flipped class, where lectures time slots were used to answer practice midterm/finals True/False questions and general content review. The projects allowed us to take a practical approach to the concepts covered in lecture. Understand that the project can be immensely difficult!",
        "Projects were great in terms of cementing the concepts from lecture.",
        "The video lectures were decent.",
        "We had flipped classroom structure, which I really appreciated. Video lectures could be re\u2013watched again for review. Actual in\u2013class time was only 30 minutes 2x/week, which we used to review T/F questions that Professor Haryadi gave us.",
        "There is a flipped classroom model, so lectures were pre\u2013recorded but very helpful because Professor Haryadi Gunawi is good at explaining things. Class time was usually about twenty minutes and we filled out true/false questions which showed up on the test later so they were helpful for reinforcing concepts and studying. The pintos projects where we coded some parts of a small operating system taught design skills and some details about how operating system implementations work, but they felt mostly separate from the lectures.",
        "lectures were very helpful in contributing to my understanding of os concepts. the projects seemed a bit much for what i gained out of it but they were somewhat helpful nonetheless",
        "Projects made up the bulk of the work and had us implement different areas of the operating system in C. Lectures were converted into short reviews of multiple choice handouts that were given each lecture day. Watching videos and going to class to review answers were integral to understanding the course content."

      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "This professor started off the class by saying \"Welcome to hell. This class will teach you how to hate yourself\". He said this in a joking manner. I can personally attest that he was not joking. Don't take other hard classes at the same time as this one, preferably take 3 classes.",
        "I've taken networks, architecture, and operating systems, and this course by far has the most rewarding (and time consuming) projects. If you actually do the work, you will have an intuitive sense of how things should work, if for no reason other than you've been staring at and modifying OS code for tens of hours. I suggest you find a strong partner, or you'll end up with a *lot* more work than your peers.\n\nI wonder if this comment will show up in the introduction lecture. Spooky!",
        "The Pintos projects are extremely time consuming, so be prepared to spend 20\u201330 hours per project if you are not a seasoned C programmer.",
        "Great course and organization; Professor and TAs really tried their best to make the course as good as possible.\nHowever, you HAVE to be extremely motivated and interested in OS. I thought I would be able to do well, but just kind of gave up at the end because of the amount of work of the projects and all the new material we learn.",
        "spent so much time on this course but it was (mostly) worth it",
        "Haryadi is a great prof, the TAs are great, the projects are completely ass. They take so much time for debugging, but the class is fire.",
        "This class is so difficult. I think it's a little ridiculous that you get a \u201320% deduction when receiving a copy of an incomplete project when that project is necessary for the next one. Isn't the point of a project to do that specific project? We should be able to focus on the project at hand, not stressing about completing the previous one without TA help when the focus is the next project. That policy just seems like a needless slap in the face.",
        "Very challenging course but a ton of fun!",
        "It's a great course! Take it! It's not as hard as you thought it would be.",
        "This course is very, very difficult. The projects are HARD, although it is very possible to do well and even get 100% on all of them. This requires a LOT of time, effort, and discipline, and you MUST start early. I mean 3\u2013days\u2013before\u2013the\u2013first\u2013day early. The projects are partner based, and you will need the help. Picking a good partner who is just as dedicated and who you work well with is essential. The course content from lectures is challenging, but ALL of the exam content comes from the lectures. There are never any surprises. If you study the lectures hard, you will do well on the exams, but this also requires time and effort. I would not recommend this class in a 4\u2013class quarter. I took only 3 classes this quarter, and this course still took up a majority of my time. OS is incredibly worth the effort, but it requires a lot of strong commitment. Regardless, this is one of the best classes I have taken so far. I learned a TON about how computer systems work, and I feel like I now have a much clearer understanding of how software interacts with hardware resources through the operating system layer. This course will prepare you extremely well for other systems courses, but I believe that taking another systems course before this one will be wise, as the projects require skills in effectively dividing up programming work, and require fairly high comfort with C.",
        "I really appreciated how the lecture content almost exactly mirrored what showed up on the exams. There was not a lot of ambiguity about what to expect, even though the content itself was quite difficult to comprehend on my first try.\nIt's best to talk to Prof. Gunawi after every class if you ever have a question about the T/F. It'll make your exam prep a whole lot easier if you don't have a bunch of ambiguous T/F questions from different lectures that you need to clarify over Ed.",
        "Undoubtedly the hardest course in the major, but the TAs and course instructor do set you up for success. Hardly anyone will get lower than a B/B\u2013, and the struggle with the projects do help reinforce critical ideas regarding a very difficult but important discipline (concurrency will always be frustrating, and courses like this are one of the only ways to fully grasp these concepts). The project infrastructure is fairly ancient and unintuitive at times, but that's the core of Operating Systems as a study\u2013it's meant to be resilient, it all depends on your implementation!",
        "I think that the ellipses in the slides and the requirement to be in class for T/F were a little gratuitous. If the lectures are already online, why require us to come to class for 20 mins just to get participation points?",
        "The professor doesn't really teach anything outside of the pre\u2013recorded lectures. The projects are all shortened from the original. You would learn much more by just reading OSTEP at your own pace instead of worrying about the lectures. The teaching style forces memorization over understanding.",

Because all of the exam content is from the lectures, I very much appreciated having the videos to go back to and review. Haryadi is excellent at explaining the concepts with examples, and I like the \"narrative\" style that covers many different ways that people have thought to solve OS problems that led to the methods we use today.",

We often only met for ~30 minutes for Q&A, when we had 80 minutes allocated for the class. I suppose this compensates for the time we spend watching the videos, but I'm less concerned about spending a lot of time on a class, and more concerned about maximizing what I get out of it. That said, the flipped format *did work well*, so there's nothing to be concerned about there, assuming you actually watch the lecture videos (don't get behind!)",
        "Nothing.",

I think the flipped classroom style is a good idea, but sometimes I found it reaaally hard to find motivation to watch lecture videos, especially with the amount of work that the projects already give you. Maybe there could be some change there, but overall flipped probably better.",

        "Perhaps spend a little bit more time in\u2013class going over or referencing the relevant slide/example again when discussing a T/F question that has more contention or that students are confused on. Sometimes it felt a bit rushed in class time, even if the answers and content are available in the videos to look over again.",
        "More accessibility with regard to help with projects.",
        "Reduce the amount of documentation we have to go through to actually do the projects; If, instead, some of the initial Pintos content was covered/explained in a video, it would make this process a whole lot easier.\nMoreover, I found the setup for the first project a little difficult to follow, especially when the instructions were split into multiple different documents and it was unclear which we needed to complete first. If a TA were to just do a short video setting up his machine, cloning the repo, and running the tests, it might have made the setup process slightly faster.",
        "I think the pre\u2013recorded lecture videos are clearly a bit out of date. I think Professor Gunawi could really help students by going back and remaking some of the places in the videos where there are errors or things that have changed since the videos were recorded. Especially since the in class time is actually pretty short, the pre\u2013recorded lectures really should be nice and polished.\n\nI also think that some of the Pintos documentation could be cleaned up to make the way we are supposed to interface with the preexisting code base more clear. I think I spent a lot of time just trying to fumble my way through a pretty dense maze of C code to just understand what functions I was supposed to call to do the thing I wanted to do. Is this thing abstracted away from me? Do I need to directly memset this thing? I think those questions could be answered pretty quickly without learning any pedagogical value.",

He always seemed lost whenever I asked him a question and it wasn't unusual for him to give students contradictory/incorrect information that brought more harm than good. For example, near the end of the project, several students were dealing with a persistent bug (specifically deals with freeing of frame table frames in pagedir.c) that\u2013\u2013 as it turns out\u2013\u2013 was caused by very basic misconceptions in advice given by Roy.\n\nI am curious about how much time Roy spent in actually preparing for his role as TA; he gives me the impression of having only briefly skimmed over the reference solution/Pintos guide documents once.\n\nThe rest of the TAs (Ruidan Li, Daniar Kurniawan, and Ray Andrew) were so wonderfully helpful.",

Before starting a project, I'd recommend you actually understand wtf you're trying to implement otherwise you'll be lost in a sea of code.\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS\nIf you want to become a react or javascript coder, that's totally cool, but you're in college. You can always pick up the more \"practical\" skills later on, but this is one of the rare opportunities where you can solidify your understanding of concepts. You'll be thankful so that next time, you don't just blindly copy and paste a Stack Overflow answer. Maybe you'll understand just a bit more how a computer actually works ;)",

Final was very manageable.\n\nOS projects are much harder than the Networks projects, but for different reasons.\n\u2013 In networks the main challenge is decrypting extremely vague and unhelpful technical manuals, with relatively straightforward implementation.\n\u2013 In OS, the implementation is hard. First aspect: multithreading. You will spend many days debugging elusive concurrency bugs. Second aspect: lots of frontloaded complexity. For large chunks of the projects you have to work without any feedback from tests\u2013\u2013 e.g. implementing frame table in p3 or rewriting the entire filesystem in p4 (the code simply doesn't compile until you reimplement everything); you have to learn how to peel back one layer, one bug at a time.\n\nHere's how the projects rank in difficulty...:\np1 <<<< p2 << p4 < p3\n\np3 and p4 build on p2 (p1 is independent from everything else) so it's VITAL you do well on this project.

Having that structure was great. You're forced to think about designing the code, which isn't such a common requirement in classes, and only then do you actually implement it. Prof. Hoffman said at the start that the more you really work through the design, the more the code will just flow from your fingers when you're actually implementing it. And he was right.",

But he also structures the assignments so you have to think about designing and testing it. The grading is also not that bad; it's more about thinking through your design plans and understanding the performance results you get. Concurrency bugs are the worst but the course isn't that bad."

The lectures were fun but were of little value most of the time as they were unconnected from the assignments in my opinion and the assignments are the meat of the course. Lots of the learning is independent. The reading responses did not contribute, as I just rushed them because I had no time. The lectures were tested on by the midterm/final but otherwise were not too necessary.",
        "Lectures covered a HUGE breadth of material from OS security, to statistical concepts like Differential privacy, to Networking to web security. Assignments were more focussed on a specific aspect (digital certificates, password cracking etc.), but taught us a lot in depth. Reading responses exposed us to more niche aspects in security.",
        "Assignments and lecture slides.",
        "The lectures were largely unhelpful and did not cover the material required for the assignments. The assignments themselves were overwhelming and did not contribute to my learning in any meaningful way. I had to rely heavily on external resources, such as Google, to complete the assignments.",
        "The assignments are very time consuming, think taking up two days, if not three or four , a week.The lectures were good, but the exams questions were very specific on small details on the slides which made it a bit frustrating.",
        "Lectures were always pretty great, very interesting and fast paced but questions were very encouraged and discussions were pretty good too. The reading responses I would say are mostly useless\u2013 the readings are interesting but in a course with THIS much work?? Seriously?? They take like 1\u20132 hours and are ONE percent of your grade, in a class that on average assigns about 25 hours of work per week or more. More on that later, but the assignments, torturous and soul\u2013sucking as they were, were generally very interesting and forced me to learn a TON, even if I did have to teach myself like 95% of the skills required to get the interesting parts of the assignment.",
        "The lectures and assignments were mostly good. Some of them were REALLY long, the exams made the class super stressful, and the readings were kinda tedious and not very helpful.",
        "The assignments are hands on, so whenever I am actually able to do the assignments fully, I could readily grasp the concepts that they wanted me to learn.",
        "Lectures given by David, Blase, or both were informative and engaging, but often very fast and loaded with information that we didn\u2019t actually end up needing. They were also often redundant to the readings in terms of content but did help clarify more opaque concepts. David and Blase are both very good lecturers, they just had lot of content to cover in a short quarter.\n\nReadings were assigned to be done before a given week\u2019s lectures. They typically consisted of a chapter or scattered (related) textbook sections, and 1+ articles either on a real attack or company protocol that made use of the principles we were learning. Unfortunately, after a while it became more time effective to read only the parts of the weekly readings that directly pertained to the reading response assignments and hope the lecture covered the rest.\n\nWe had a weekly reading response due on Tuesdays at midnight. Each assignment had either 1\u20132 paragraph\u2013response questions asking for summaries or opinions or ~10? shorter comprehension/recall questions. These mostly felt like busy work, especially when they didn\u2019t succeed in encouraging people to actually do the readings early, they just forced people to ctrl\u2013f articles to mark the assignment as complete.\n\nThe real kicker for this course was the weekly assignments, usually (sort of) assigned Fridays to be due the following Thursday. These assignments were long\u2014from complicated set up and having to teach yourself background on an entirely new tool or language never demonstrated in class (e.g. Wireshark, Hashcat, jQuery/PHP), from having to sit and babysit code running for hours, from having many many subparts and write ups after the technical parts were completed, or from busy work like making visualizations for analysis on questions that essentially just asked for a single numeric answer. One student asked a professor how long would be reasonable to complete a particular assignment (as he had already spent 16+ hours on it and had not finished) and the professor matter of factly stated that this assignment was expected to take roughly 25 hours. This was just one of the 8 weekly assignments, assigned to be completed in less than a week.\n\nAll things considered I do think I learned a lot, however the majority of the technical skills are entirely self taught. Hours of reading documentation just to get started on assignments.",
        "Lectures introduced ideas which were reinforced by homeworks",
        "The lectures were great, y'all are great at fielding our questions thoroughly yet efficiently.\nThe assignments were... a lot. Everyone filling out this form is probably telling you to reduce the workload. I don't want you to reduce the workload. They were generally pretty good, I kinda didn't like hashcat (too slow) and I really hated generating graph after graph for analyzing the certificates. Crib dragging, Ghost, and tracking/fingerprinting were really good assignments. I thought that buffer overflow was good too.\nReadings \u2013 these were good. The reading responses were fine, I guess they helped me internalize what I had read?\nTests \u2013 these were standard, I thought they were fair.",
        "Homework helped a lot to understand, cramming for test (after homework) is also crucial for strengthening understanding",
        "Lectures were most helpful. Textbook assignments and other readings felt unnecessary",
        "Lectures were helpful at explaining topics. OH were also helpful at explaining unclear topics or instructions. The professors were very nice and eager to explain everything. The only thing that hindered them was limited time. They were very willing to work with the students and were very kind with extenuating circumstances.",
        "The assignments are interesting and could be fun sometimes, however we were not well\u2013equipped to succeed in this class. I had to learn about machine learning, networking, PHP, html, javascript, selenium, mysql, and more, all for homework assignments that took days to complete and involved a deep understanding of subjects such as networking, none of which were prerequisites for the course. It took an incredible amount of time to complete assignments, especially considering many of us have 3 other classes and a life outside of school. The late policy was very strict, especially considering how long these assignments took. Readings were sometimes intriguing, but sometimes far too dense, and reading responses took a lot of time to complete. Finals and exams were challenging.",

      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "I was apprehensive about the workload going into the class (expect anywhere from 10\u201330 hours a week), but this class is hands down my favorite class I've taken at UChicago. All of the assignments were really interesting, and I learned so much.",
        "The course feels like it is still a fetus in development. The structure is not streamlined and the assignments are bloated with auxiliary work that the professors argue is intentional to put you in a real\u2013world setting, but then the time to adjust/figure things out is unrealistic given the constant weekly workload. The topics were so interesting, that it is frustrating how annoying some of the assignments could be.",
        "The course taught me an incredible amount; I felt like I learnt more than a lot of other CS courses combined. However, the workload was FREAKING insane, even compared to other PLS classes like Networks or Databases. Assignments often took 15\u201330 hours (big variation), often unnecessarily because assignment questions were poorly worded, or spending time dealing with setting up new technologies (e.g. Apache, MySQL, HashCat). Apparently the instructors \"toned down the assignments\" compared to previous quarters, which I find quite hard to believe.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this course to all CS majors because it's just so interesting and you learn so much, but don't take 4 courses/do an internship with this unless you are fine with having absolutely no life.",
        "A warning to those who dare take,\nThis course, that's akin to a heartbreak,\nFor it's a burden too heavy to bear,\nAnd one that leaves you in despair.",
        "Great course, but time consuming.",
        "Where to begin. Seriously, if you want a life outside this class, and you're taking even one other slightly difficult or time consuming class, DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!! I knew what I was going into when I signed up for the course, and planned accordingly, and had friends in the class who were instrumental from keeping me from death/a breakdown, but it was still one of the most time\u2013consuming and frustrating classes I've ever taken, and unfortunately also one of the most conceptually interesting.",
        "While I feel like many improvements were made to this course, the professors still do not want to respect us as students with other coursework besides this one. The main issue was overloading us on the most stressful week (midterms) by giving us an exam on top of our usual readings and projects; the two hardest projects were back to back and during the same time period as our exam. This alone made me feel not respected as a student.",
        "Overall, the assignment workload is ridiculous. I understand that assignments can take time, but these assignments contain things that take too much time to look up, and have NOTHING to do with the concepts that we are learning. I am okay with 30 minute of extra time devoted to figuring out errors and googling about it, but I and a lot of other people take 3 other classes, we need to devote time to those classes as well and turn in quality work for those classes, so is it so much to ask that most of the set up is done before the assignment is released so we only spend time learning the concepts that are necessary for us to learn and not waste time trying to figure out some arbitrary error? A list of potential errors that we may come across so that we can more quickly look up a fix to the issue?",
        "Definitely know C and Python (especially Pandas). Be prepared for this assignment to be a lot of work. Start assignments early if possible, a lot of the assignments were doable just endlessly long. It sucks to start an assignment and realize you could have it done in time if you didn\u2019t have to wait x hours for the code to finish running. The full syllabus/schedule form past years is available on their class website, so look there for more info.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to narrow down what exactly would be tested on the midterm and final. There is a lot of info and the depth you\u2019re expected to know about varies a lot.\n\nThis class was difficult to manage in a 4 course quarter (with algos) and significant (~20 hr/wk) extracurriculars.\n\nGrades came back slow.",
        "Some of the homeworks were much longer than necessary. Oftentimes, the assignments were at a scale where I felt like I gained no benefit to my learning compared to a smaller and quicker assignment.",
        "The course covers a lot of interesting content, but the homework assignments often trailed off and required us to learn things that were ultimately unrelated to security. Modifying assignments or adding skeletons for a lot of tasks would have significantly improve my learning from assignments",
        "If you want to take this class, you have to know that it is a time commitment. Either you have lots of time, or you are the type of person who can sit down and learn something like PHP or Selenium or Wireshark very quickly (maybe \"learn\" is the wrong word, maybe \"kludge together code you find in documentation / Stack Overflow\" is the right word)\nIt helps if you know:\n\nC somewhat well (I did)\npython somewhat well (I did)\npandas / matplotlib a little (I did)\njavascript / HTML a little (I did)\nPHP a little (I did not)\nSelenium / web crawling a little (I did not)\nWireshark a little (I did not)\nApache a little (I did not)\nCryptography a little (I did)\nNetworks concepts a little (I did)\nSQL a little (I did)\nUnix somewhat well (I did)\n\nYou don't need all of this of course (I didn't have all of it), and a lot of those (I did)'s still required a refresher, I was super duper rusty with javascript, matplotlib, SQL, etc. You only need these 1 or 2 at a time, so its not as scary as this list seems. The main skill you need is NOT knowing all of these, its being able to figure out the basics of all of these quickly.",
        "Strongly suggest split the course into 2/3 quarter offerings. A lot of assignments and each take a lot of time",
        "This course was extremely disrespectful to students time. Assignments were delayed more often than not with shifting due dates. There were infrastructure failures for the assignments. Blase specifically stated that it was reasonable for one of eight week\u2013long assignments to take 25 hours. Assignments also frequently felt like busywork or required you to go to CSIL and allow a program to run for hours.",
        "Assignments could be helpful at getting the ideas across. However, so much time was spent on setting up assignments or doing tedious work rather than actually dealing with the material at hand. While this class taught me many useful things, I would not recommend it if they do not change how much time is spent on simply setting up assignments. Also, you deal with so many new applications and languages for each project. The assignments on their own were not too much. But assignments + reading responses +a midterm and final that were not there last year were rough. I did not help that the midterm week had an assignment and reading response due the same week.\n\nAlso the final and midterm felt completely superfluous and only served to hurt my experience of this class.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this class unless they make serious efforts to remodel the workload. It does not even have to be less, I would rather have all the work be meaningful than have less work. But so much time is spent on just getting things up and running that I could never appreciate what any of the assignments were actually trying to get across. The assignments (and the midterm and final too) did far more to hinder the knowledge that I gained from this class rather than helping it. Which is sad because the material is really interesting. Hopefully this class is fixed up for future attendees.",
        "We had a Reeading Response and Project due each week, with no exception on Midterm Week. I personally found the reading responses to be a time sink and not very useful or interesting. Although I did enjoy the class, I did think that the professors could take more accountability to negative feedback posted on the class forum."

        "Blase is a great lecturer; I liked how he spoke both theoretically but also often zoomed out to give us the bigger picture of security concepts. David is also a great lecturer; he was probably more comprehensive, especially when covering the minutiae of things like OS security and Cryptography.",
        "The lecture slides made the content greatly self\u2013explanatory.",
        "Regrettably, there was no aspect of the instructor's teaching that contributed to my learning. The workload was overwhelming and the grading policies were punitive. The lack of flexibility and willingness to work with students was disappointing. David was nicer but Blase was unforgiving.",

        "Their flexibility and understanding. They were always in the mood to talk, the only thing that ever prevented them were their busy schedules. They also did a lot to cultivate a good Campuswire environment for people to ask questions and feel safe. They know how to organize a classroom environment very well and I really appreciated that.",

      "What could the instructor modify to help you learn more?": [
        "Make the assignments less complex, or be less harsh about the grading",
        "Unfortunately their organization/planning is not great, often on assignments a significant part of the assignment would be dropped/changed just becuase some poor unfortunate souls had to struggle through it and realize something was broken, then the professors would wait until enough people complained to change something. I wish they just designed things correctly from the start. Also, please make the reading responses, lectures, and assignments tighter, as it shouldn't feel like being pulled in three different directions and two are a waste of time and one is you're learning Wireshark, PHP, javascript libraries, Xoring 400 bits, waiting 10 hours for hashcat to finish... etc.",
        "Be more understanding when it comes to workload. There were many moments when people were frustrated and staying up for many nights to finish assignments, and it was just disheartening when the instructors were unwilling to make accommodations for people with extenuating circumstances.\n\nTry to word assignments a bit better. Sometimes I felt pressured to write more than necessary for a response, just because I was worried I would get points off for missing an obscure rubric point. Maybe just putting \"(2\u20133 sentences)\" or something would be helpful.\n\nAlso, PLEASE IMPROVE THE CLASS SLIDES! The slides cover a ton of info and are interesting, but the words/diagrams on the slides are SO vague.\n\nFor example, the slides ask questions like \"Is Static or Dynamic fuzzing better for XXX circumstance?\", and don't answer the question. I understand this is meant to help us think, but it just ends up creating extra work for TAs and instructors, because people end up posting on Campuswire asking the answers to questions / clarifying unclear aspects on slides.",
        "Overall: give more weight to assignments and less to exams\nFor exams: make the exams focus on more intellectually challenging questions than testing which concepts a student remembers.\nFor assignments: give more weight to actual hacking than to explanations; assignment instructions can be more explicit; the passcode hacking assignment can be modified to challenge the intellectual than the GPU.",
        "The instructors could modify the course by significantly reducing the workload and providing more support and guidance to students. More effective teaching methods, such as more comprehensive lectures and in\u2013class discussions, could also help students better understand the material and succeed in assignments.",
        "It is just exceedingly frustrating when Blase and David are very nice and friendly and interesting lecturers, but then you leave the classroom and you remember that they literally do not care about how much of your time is wasted, how little free time you have for silly things like sleep, eating, groceries, or, you know, your other classes. It's seriously painful and pretty infuriating when you spend SO SO SO SO SO much of your time on this class, and yes, Blase and David do put a lot of work into this class too, I get that, but they must be pretty sadistic deep down, if they cannot understand that their students are overworked, constantly tired and busy, and are actually also taking other rigorous and time\u2013consuming classes, and maybe even have jobs!!! Please, I'm begging you, the class is terrific in content and learning, but have a little empathy here.",

That way we're prepared for when we come across errors and aren't left in the dark and have to use Campuswire. For me, Campuswire is a last resort because I don't want to solely rely on a person answering my questions. I also don't expect the staff to check it 24/7, so I want so badly to be able to solve my issues by myself with insight that has already been prepared in advance of creating the assignments.",

        "Understand that students have three other commitments. I understand that the coursework was shrunk for this quarter, but 25 hours for a project is disrespectful. Assignments like TOCTOU were informative, but just combing through website data and answering questions to prove we did it doesn't help us learn, it just uses up time that students need for sleep. I'm familiar with difficult courses, I took intro to database systems and it had a very high volume of work, but the work all felt important, interesting, and well\u2013organized. This class had high volume with low quality.",
        "Streamline a lot of the work and make reading responses shorter. A lot of the workload felt like busy work. I understand that getting these programs to work is what a lot of actual hackers have to do, but that's a bit much for an introduction to computer security class.",
        "Lectures could be very intense and paced far too quickly, especially Blase's. Fitting 80 slides into a lecture is simply too much. Often this class aimed for breadth over depth, where depth would have been better for our learning. It's not sufficient to explain machine learning in <30 seconds and expect students to follow easily if they haven't been exposed to it before. This is just one example of how ill\u2013paced it could be, particularly for many of us who are just out of the intro sequence. Assignments were overwhelmingly difficult and hard to complete on time, especially with the strict late policy used that prioritized finishing on time over our learning. Not everyone has 25\u201335+ hours for projects per week on top of readings and lecture, especially considering we have other classes. It's admirable that they want us to learn so much, but it's too much information in too little time to be learned effectively, especially considering how much we had to do to learn OUTSIDE of class in doing these assignments. This is the first course in my life I've turned in late assignments. My time and effort doesn't feel respected. It doesn't feel like we were set up to succeed or that learning was the key priority in this class so much as stack ranking us and putting us through an incredible amount of stress. I also want to bring up that a student used an attack we were taught in order to try to take photos on other's webcams on a site we had to visit to complete an assignment. I felt extremely uncomfortable with this happening, as well as the 10\u2013minute ethical lecture in response to it, considering the legal and ethical implications."

Networks would also be helpful since there are 2\u20133 lectures just on Networking (not even security). I was lucky to have taken these classes, but you can definitely get by without all of them (just will take more time).\n\nAdditionally, some Web development experience (PHP, Javascript) would be pretty helpful (which I had a bit).\n\nYou also need to be very comfortable learning new technologies: we learnt a new technology each week, from Hashcat (password breaking) to Wireshark (network sniffing) to Javascript, Python, Pandas, AFL (for program fuzzing), Selenium, pexpect (For automating python programs), and OpenSSL module for Python.

I thought assignments were pretty fair, if time\u2013consuming, and mostly gave me a deeper understanding of the ideas discussed in class.",

        "lectures and assignments contribute a lot. Assignments usually enhance and enforce my understanding, lecture covers a wider range of information",
        "The lectures presented to us the theories of defense, while the assignments had us practice attacking. The transition was eased by the presence of a large online forum, with the presence of both the instructors and the TAs.",
        "The profs keep the lecture humorous and interesting. A lot of the network stuff went over my head. The assignments were very painful",
        "The assignments which required us to actually carry out attacks really helped me learned how such attacks worked in real life, as well as how to protect against them. Going about teaching in this way made these concepts a lot easier to learn than just hearing about them in lectures.",
        "Lecture attendances are quite mandatory in helping understand the slides provided on Canvas (otherwise you would have to read the lengthy textbook to understand the thinking of Professor when making the slides). Assignments (programming ones) contribute the most to learning the actual course content, and help prepare for the exams.",

        "Great course!",
        "This is the worst class I have taken at UChicago. The instructors assign insane amounts of work, much of which they do not teach how to do or give any guidance for. It also tends to only be tangentially related to class topics and contributes very little to your understanding of class concepts, especially when you consider how much time it takes. While the instructors claim that this is to improve your independent research skills, it often seemed (especially for Ur assignments) that it was really a result of gross incompetence or laziness.\nI would recommend taking literally any other class above this one.",
        "huge workload",
        "A LOT OF WORK requiring many clarification, a lot of effort, and long time to setting up, I recommend taking this course as your only CS course this quarter.",
        "The problem is that this course's assignments are insanely difficult. I have pulled countless all\u2013nighters, until I was sweating blood and coffee, and my average is still in the 70s. I have run my mental health into the ground for this course\u2013\u2013stopped eating, showering, going outside, even changing clothes\u2013\u2013and received nothing in return. Even my SDS accommodation allowing me to receive extensions just made things worse\u2013\u2013it meant that these monstrous assignments took up even more time, and bled into next week. It makes me wonder why I even tried so hard.",
        "assignments 5\u20137 were too long",
        "Despite all the negative comments, I understand that the topics of cybersecurity is vague and extensive, and this is only a 9\u2013week course. Therefore, it is understandable to some degree that in order to cover all the curriculum topics, the course has to be fast\u2013paced, and workload has to be heavy.\n\nHowever, I think removing midterm and finals would help in reducing workload, as the programming assignments themselves are sufficient in reflecting technical materials learned. Alternatively, some questions in midterm and final that are geared more toward system designs rather than the technical details could be given in the form of bi\u2013weekly take\u2013home quizzes, which I think would achieve the same purpose as having midterm and final, but with a lot less stress induced on students.",
        "Okay here we go. I have a lot of comments about the class:\nI. I learnt a ton over the course of 10 weeks. Honestly, it's a little unbelievable, but after making it through you realize that you are more talented than you thought.\nII. The assignments were an absolute mess. Not every assignment was bad, in fact I think there were a couple that were even amazing and genius, but every single one was well over >20 hours (for me and for many other people. We use a forum called \"Campuswire\" [similar to Piazza, Ed, etc. but better] and on this forum there were multiple attempts to communicate this to the Professors throughout the quarter (very brave students felt that they should speak up about this). For instance let me go into detail about a specific assignment regarding Password Cracking. There will be a similar pattern to all assingments (with the exception of one), I can summarize the main point in a single or couple sentences but the assignment becomes just time\u2013consuming to accomplish (despite knowing what to do). So for this one, the idea is simple: MD5 is super bad! You can crack million of these hashes per second, meaning that if people get their hands on the hashes, they will get your password. Easy enough to understand right? Now comes the \"fun\" part: download hashcat on your computer and decrypt hashes that you find on the assingment. My computer only ran 10k Hashes per second. Guess what? There are people with Gaming Computer that can run 10 Million Hashes per second. I didn't realize CSIL machines ran faster, but I came to learn of this because people were leaving CSIL machines online and leaving Sticky Notes to not turn off. Why is this possible? Becuase with Hashcat you just give it a rule and then it will continue to hash until it has finished the rule. This can just take hours, so you are just sitting and staring at a screen to finish. There are better strategies, sure. And I think that's the point of the assingment. But after I moved to the CSIL machines (which ran 80x faster than my computer), I finished in 3\u20134 hours. So I wasted 2 whole days with my computer not turning off, where my strategies were great, but I just don't have the power.\nNow I'll give another example of this: Crib Dragging in part of an assingment. After you learn what crib dragging is (which is not that difficult, just have to look at logic statements again), you have to implement. I cannot begin to describe how tiresome this process was. I knew that my attack was working, I was getting through and uncovering the sentences. But it still took upwards of 4 hours just to get the sentences. Now, in the defense of the course, professors said that students could look up the sentences online after they have reached a certain point, reducing the assingment time significantly.",
        "so hard, but rewarding",
        "the course is incredibly well\u2013designed, interesting, and useful in terms of getting insight into the workings of computer systems. as a CS minor without much programming experience beyond the intro sequence (from 2 years ago), I will say the assignments were extremely time\u2013consuming and sometimes difficult to manage with other classes. I am happy to have taken the class, though. course provides a survey of a range of topics from buffer overflows to networks, DNS, HTTP, privacy and the assignments are quite cool to work on",

Every homework is pretty well\u2013designed and pretty fun actually, there were just too many of them.\nAlso, please consider modifying the hashcat homework, which basically just depends on the hardware the student was using. I spent hours developing strategies and wordlists and only cracked a pathetic number of passwords before I brute forced the remaining 100+ with a good GPU in less than 10 minutes. I feel like a good assignment should depend more on students' algorithms and strategies instead of their hardware. Or at least the minimum hardware requirement should have been made clear before students dive into the assignments.\nBesides this one assignment, everything else was fun and reasonable!

I think that the lectures that were really long (especially when they were during what was supposed to be lab time but ended up just being more lecture time) were less effective ways of learning the material. While I did learn from some of the assignments, there were too many and they were too hard so myself and my peers ended up sacrificing a lot of sleep and our other classes in order to get the work done, which definitely undermined my learning. I think it was also a problem because there were 7 homework assignments that were all pretty hard, that myself and friends worked really really hard on, but then the professor later said that our grade hinged entirely on the final project. It was confusing and frustrating at times.",

        "hope to learn more about pcb design tips and best practices. We also need more equipment and space. there is usually a line when it comes to using equipment.",
        "I have mixed feelings about this course. On the one hand, I learned a lot in a very shot time and I think the learn\u2013by\u2013doing structure was great for this. I enjoyed the freedom of the final project. The prof and the TA clearly put in a heroic amount of work to make the class function at all. On the other hand, I think too many hours were expected of students outside of class/lab and not all the assignments seemed necessary for learning the material. For example, one assignment where we had to take apart a piece of old electronics required 10\u201312 hours of work and we only had 2 days to do it, which seemed unreasonable. I think the solution to this is to limit assignments like these to the lab time \u2013\u2013 a two hour lab would have been plenty of time to take apart the electronics and get a sense of understanding what's inside. The full cataloguing + slideshow + blog post was overkill. Some of the earlier labs included mini lectures \u2013\u2013 I also don't think any lab time should be spent on lecture, really it should be for working on these assignments. Lastly, to really make this course effective would require many more TAs (maybe 5 total). There were points where I was quite lost and would have loved to chat with a TA during TA hours (there were no TA hours) \u2013\u2013 while I could email questions, sometimes when you're sufficiently confused there's no way to condense the question into an email and the responses to the emails could be quite short.",
        "Pedro needs a better space and more tools to make this course really shine. We regularly did not have enough soldering stations for students to finish their assignments in the time frame that was convenient to them. Also, the fact that this class is a wiki and not a canvas course added unnecessary complexity. Canvas courses don't require me to remember the class website password nor do they require me to hunt down where the submission link is for a particular assignment.\n\nAlso, I would like a syllabus that tells me how much each assignment is worth for my grade. The grading for this class seems very fair, however without a full breakdown I don't know where I stand. Honestly, given the fact that this is a project course, I would advocate to change the grading style to a completion + effort style instead of a \"correct\u2013ness\" style. My feeling is that Pedro kinda does a mix of both but the latter style would allow me/future students to push themselves in technical complexity.",
        "okay, so a few things to unpack here:\n\u2013 first, prof. lopes is really nice in person (i.e. very willing to explain concepts to you if you ask), but somehow comes off as mean over email. I'm not the only student who has had this experience.\n\u2013 this class only has CMSC15400 as a prerequisite. however, it would be greatly beneficial if you had prior experience with electronics before coming into this class. I had no prior experience whatsoever (the last time I even vaguely touched E&M was in high school and I remembered nothing from it) and felt like I was thrown into the deep end from assignment 1. it got better over the quarter, but I feel like the folks who had prior electronics experience were overall much more comfortable than those without it. this kind of knowledge and experience disparity really does make a significant difference; there was only so much help you could get (office hours was essentially the lab, which is a couple hours per week), and everyone was fighting over resources. at times, it felt like I was just expected to know things, even though the course only has CMSC15400 as an explicit prerequisite.\n\u2013 shan\u2013yuan teng, our TA for this quarter, was absolutely amazing. I felt bad at times; there was so much work he did (sorting components for students, holding extra office hours for students before the final project was due, staying long hours passed what was required of him helping students). I'm not sure I could've gotten through this class without him. shan\u2013yuan, if you're reading this by any chance, thank you so much! you're amazing.\n\u2013 romain nith, a grad student in prof. lopes' lab, was taking this course this quarter but also acted as an unofficial TA. romain was also really helpful! romain, if you're reading this by any chance, thank you for taking the time to help students while also having to balance getting your own projects done! you're a kicad god.\n\u2013 this class really needs an Ed, or at least something like it. communication is done via email, and it's difficult to keep track of all the emails sometimes. more importantly, I feel like students would benefit from a discussion forum where they could post their questions, which are often shared by other students. this would also take pressure off of the professor and TA(s), since students could help each other over Ed.\n\u2013 there's a class wiki and a class website, each of which contain important information about the course. having information spread across two locations, coupled with communication being over email, made things confusing at times. (in case you're wondering: we did not have a canvas page for this course.)\n\u2013 grades weren't really delivered back to us in a consistent manner, nor in a timely manner. grades were communicated over email. we were not given a breakdown of how much things would be weighted. for example, we did not receive information as to how much the final project was weighted; we were just told that it mattered a lot.\n\u2013 in case it might be helpful information, we did not use a textbook in this course. the professor would post lecture slides on the class website after class.",
        "Success on the final project required a TON of work outside of class, but also hinged on the PCB being correct when it was submitted to be made in a factory and sent back to us. We were told we would have multiple rounds of feedback to ensure what we submitted was correct, which we did, but then after they came back from the factory, some were told their PCB wouldn't work because of an error that should have been caught during the feedback session (it was too late at that point), even though during the feedback sessions they were told their PCB was good and ready to go. I think this happened because the prof and TA were totally over worked and spent many, many late nights getting everything together to make the assignments for this class happen. While I appreciate this, I think something is wrong if the Prof. and TA are totally overworked just by the logistics of the class, too much so to have time to give every student the feedback or help when things go wrong. I think the class needs to be redesigned so that the Prof. and TA don't have to work all day and night, skipping meals and sleep to just make the logistics of the class happen making it hard for them to give feedback or assistance to the students.",

Reading period is there for a reason, and we don't have classes during finals for a reason. Myself and a lot of friends had to skip our other classes and pull all nighters to get this the final project done since we were in classes that week and we had a very quick turn around time to do this assignment. In general, the instructor should have less assignments, less difficult assignments, more time to do the final project, and a smaller scope for the final project. I don't think we should have had to solder the final project. That caused a lot of unnecessary problems. I think if we had the final project factory soldered we'd still end up using our soldering skills to solder and desolder to fix errors in the project, but be able to spend the time we save focusing on the more important aspects of the project than just hours and hours soldering.",

Pedro did his very best to try and make the course accessible to those with limited EE knowledge (short circuit segments, design patterns, regular feedback). This made the class do\u2013able but does not take away from the difficulties entailed in the subject matter. As such, I don't know how the class could be made easier \u2013\u2013 this class is simply a large time sink. Thankfully, you do learn a lot.",
        "This class was a lot of work and it was really hard. The instructions were sometimes vague and I would stress out a lot trying to do all the requirements but then what we got graded on didn't end up being in line with what was communicated about the assignments. It was really hard and took a lot of time. I would only take this if you are only taking 2 other classes that quarter and they're both really easy classes.",
        "At first, I was very worried about how the course would go, but because you learn so much on your own I eventually was able to reasonably enjoy the course without the worry of the difficulty. The more you focus on your assignments the grades will follow and it won't be as difficult as you might think. Just get your hands dirty and be creative in your assignments/projects and you will be rewarded",

        "The lectures (and pre\u2013recorded lectures) were super helpful for learning about the material, but the assignments really forced us to put the concepts into practice. I don't think I'd understand TCP quite the same if I hadn't gone through the grueling process of developing the protocol myself.",
        "We had several resources at our disposal\u2013 in addition to lectures there were also videos and links to a free online textbook to supplement our knowledge. There are three projects in which you are required to work with a partner, facilitating collaborative/communication skills. Two homework assignments tested our knowledge and served as preparation for the final exam. The ESNU grading scale is designed to motivate learning and improvement.",
        "The projects were hard, but allowed you to truly dig deep into some of the network protocols. There was limited guidance on implementation though starter code was provided, and we had to parse through RFC manuals ourselves.\n\nThe HWs allowed you to reflect on content in the lecture videos.\n\nI did not attend in\u2013person lectures as I found that the videos served to cover the same content and more.",
        "Lectures and pre\u2013recorded videos were good for understanding the material and the projects went a lot more in depth and were decently challenging",
        "Lectures were helpful, though the prerecorded supplementary videos provided most of the details. Projects were helpful in seeing how certain protocols could be implemented. Homeworks solidified my conceptual understanding.",
        "The online lectures were more helpful than the in\u2013person lectures with learning new material and priming me for the in\u2013person lectures. When in class, though, it was helpful to have the professor available to answer questions which helped fill in the gaps from learning online. The projects and homeworks were great at cementing the theoretical topics we discussed in class.",
        "The content lectures and extra review sessions were incredibly helpful. The homeworks felt like a good way to reinforce the basic ideas of networking. The project based lectures didn't contribute much to my understanding .",
        "Live lectures were generally unhelpful, they were basically just discussions of material covered in video lectures (which were amazing) and questions about the projects. I think most of the class stopped going to lecture pretty quickly. Homework assignments (there were only two) were very good practice and tested our knowledge quite well.\n\nThis is very important for anyone taking this class to know: there are three coding projects (IRC, TCP, and routing), and they will overtake your life. I literally spent entire days working on them. They aren't conceptually difficult, but it takes so much work to figure out what on earth you're supposed to do to begin with and then also interpret these Internet manuals. Also, you're only implementing a subset of the manuals but that honestly makes it harder because you have to keep checking what you're supposed to skip, etc. I also don't really think the projects improved my learning that much because they just went into so much detail that I personally find unnecessary.",

On the other hand, I did not enjoy the Thursday project lectures. While they gave you a quickstart understanding of the project, all of the information covered would be re\u2013encountered while working through the project, so the net benefit seemed negligible.\n\nAfter each content lecture, an approximately equal amount of time worth of videos (a bit more than an hour) were assigned. These were marketed as largely extra information, but were required in order to perform well on the homeworks and final exam. It seems to me that a much superior arrangement would be to only cover content in class, and instead assign optional project quick\u2013start videos for those who found that content helpful.",
        "The videos provided by Professor Borja are concise and clear. If you watch the videos and understand everything, there is no need to consult any textbook.",
        "Lectures were divided into normal content lectures on Tuesdays, and project\u2013based lectures on Thursdays. Additionally, there were lecture videos that dropped after the Tuesday lectures, with more info.\n\nThe Tuesday lectures were engaging and useful. However, in some ways they felt like primers for the lecture videos. I mean that they helped me going into the denser videos, but the videos were the real source of knowledge. However, the Q+A heavy in\u2013person lectures were still very useful.\n\nAs I implied above, the videos extend and expand upon the lectures, so much so that when I reviewed by notes I looked almost exclusively at the video notes.\n\nThe Thursday lectures talked about the projects \u2013 they kinda felt out of place. There were some that were definitely super useful, and there were some (more the Q+A ones) that I felt I could have skipped. For context though, we did super well on the projects, so maybe interpret my experience in that light.\n\nHomeworks \u2013 These were pretty easy, and there were only 2 of them. They helped me feel prepared for the test.\n\nProjects \u2013 On average, these were great. The best part of the course was digging into network stuff directly. The resubmission system was very nice (we didn't need it, but it lowered the pressure), and you are wise to split the grade by test completeness and code quality.\n\n\u2013 Chirc: The chat server. This felt a lot like the CS220 project. It was design\u2013heavy, and in some ways (if you did it right) you end up fully separating the network code from the application code. There was a lot to do, and I feel like there was limited value to some of the later tasks (I guess learning mutexes was good). My least favorite project, but still good.\n\n\u2013 Chitcp: My favorite project. Makes you learn TCP inside and out. I would change basically nothing. This was great.\n\n\u2013 Chirouter: This one was pretty good too \u2013 much shorter than the other two. Mininet is a huge pain though, and it took me forever to get the right virtual machine working with a mininet install that worked, and even after we had some wacky tests that wouldn't work until you ran them individually and then they would work (even in aggregate).\n\nThe test \u2013 I was too stressed out about this, I wanted that +3 grade level up, which meant I needed 27/30 questions, which seemed hard. In reality, all the questions except the 6 \"challenge questions\" were pretty easy, so I guess it was fair.\n\nThe grading scheme is different, and I think it could use some tweaking. A friend and I determined that, looking at it a certain way, you can view the test as weighing 60%\u201370% of the grade \u2013 if you had done perfectly before the test, you still needed 27/30 on the test for that A. (of course, viewed in another way, the weight was like 20%). I like specifications grading, but it worked better in my other class than here. Also, what was with the lack of partial credit?",

        "A great course and lived up to the hype. I would complain about the workload, but I feel like Borja and TAs were pretty fair about deadlines and allowing for resubmissions.\n\nword of warning: START EARLY, ESPECIALLY PROJECT 1!! *well all the projects but especially project 1*",
        "I found that the grading scheme of the course, though, it is not relative to others, was pretty harsh, and required spending a LOT of time on projects. Though the resubmission policy is nice, the base grade calculation requires you to do extremely well on almost all the project aspects. This caused a lot of unnecessary stress in terms of trying to debug just a few tests.",
        "Seems a little harsh that we can only get three questions wrong on the final exam to get an A.",
        "My impression of this course is that it goes far too much into detail on certain topics, leaving us lacking a high\u2013level overview. The projects take a ridiculous amount of time to complete. Also don't take this class unless you already know who your partner is going to be for the quarter.",
        "Beware that the projects take a fair bit of time. Its not a class for procrastinators.",
        "This course is very, very difficult, but immensely fulfilling. If you do not have experience working with large, complex programming projects, especially in a group, you will find the projects quite challenging (as I sure did). All the course projects require working with a partner, so if possible, I highly, highly recommend taking this course together with someone you know you can work well with. This course is a large time commitment, and earning an A is possible, but requires a very large amount of work and a very, very strong understanding of ALL of the course concepts.",

However, I feel the lecture is a bit unstructured (Perhaps because Professor Borja knows the education videos are great, he tried to use lecture time to provide examples and motivations). Also, it would be awesome if Professor Borja can provide a list of network\u2013related terminal commands next time. Overall, even though I am not a system person, I have to admit this course is a great one and CS students should take it.",

Classes like Architecture, OS, Networks, or Parallel Computing come to mind. However, I think the projects were toned down to be more manageable this year, so you could probably manage without. Also, the class would be more interesting (but not necessary) if you have taken Algorithms, as there are quite a few sorting / quickest path / cycle detection algos used in DB systems. However, you don't need to prove or understand these algorithms deeply at all.\n\nIt is probably helpful to have taken Architecture, OS, or Parallel Computing more specifically, because it will be helpful when discussing things like Memory Hierarchy or Concurrency.",

        "Elmore is a great lecturer; he's funny and can answer questions w/ ease. I thought the assignments were well\u2013formulated and extremely manageable in the allotted time. CrustyDB 1 was the hardest conceptually, but fulfilling to finish; CrustyDB 2 is simpler but can require more debugging and optimizations, if you have issues in the first part; CrustyDB 3 is the simplest, though it's helpful to understand parts of the code base that are provided. I thought the midterm was well\u2013written and tested knowledge in a fair way. If you attend lecture and look over the posted lecture notes, you should be prepared. Overall, I thought the class could benefit from more challenging projects. I know the professor mentioned that the difficulty of projects was reduced in comparison to previous years. Personally, I prefer more challenging projects rather than the addition of a midterm and final.",

Also, Prof. Elmore's responses on Ed weren't always clear or easy to parse, whereas the TAs and Prof. Rehman tended to be pretty thorough with their responses.",

What was great about the introductory sequence was that every project or piece of homework was directly related to what we had been learning in lecture. In this course, that was true for the first phase of the project only. Parts 2 and 3 felt like arbitrary implementation of trivial elements of databases; the knowledge gained from these phases was not tested on exams, nor was it particularly central in lectures. This meant nothing on the exams (based on lectures only) ever got reinforced, and the end result of the CrustyDB project was that I learned how to program the file storage system of a database as well as some aggregation functions."

The professor went through the slides at a manic pace, refusing to slow down, and then didn't post them online in time for the homework assignments. We wasted 3 weeks learning linear algebra instead of computer science, and then only studied theory. At the same time, all of our homework assignments and projects were on practical programming, which was not discussed at all in class, and was in a programming language and API none of us had ever learned before. As such, none of us were able to complete the assignments. Our professor didn't even know the API, and repeatedly gave us broken or incorrect source code, leading us to waste hours of our time before he got his act together. He even gave us broken code for GitHub sections, proving that it was less his lack of knowledge and more his lack of interest in teaching. Then, the teacher would tell us he was off to go watch opera, so he couldn't do office hours, or that he was late because he was getting a coffee\u2013\u2013rubbing salt in the wound. Perhaps the worst was when he assigned our final project 3 days before Thanksgiving break, due the day after the break. We asked if we would be able to email him questions, and he said \"Oh no, I'll be off\u2013grid enjoying my vacation.\" Truly hypocritical and absurd.",

The lectures were all on theoretical concepts, and we were expected to teach ourselves the practical programming, in a language/API we had never used. As such, we were unable to solidify our understanding of the theory, because we were never able to apply it. The TAs didn't even show up to the labs half the time, and when they did show up, they often didn't know how to help us, or had been given broken code by the professor.",
        "Lectures contained all required conceptual information, and homework tested these concepts pretty well.\nLabs were intended to get you familiar with Vulkan, but the writeups were often inadequate, either being just copy\u2013and\u2013paste or completely open\u2013ended.\nThe projects were a nightmare. The sheer number of Vulkan APIs and bookkeeping required added hours upon hours of additional work that you had to do before you could even write any actual graphics/shader code. The amount of work was just completely unreasonable given the timeframe.",
        "Lectures introduced new rendering techniques and the math/theory behind them. Written homework assignments and the exam consisted of short problems that tested our understanding of these concepts. All of these components were well\u2013designed and built upon each other.\n\nProjects were large\u2013scale programming assignments using the Vulkan C++ library and labs were meant to introduce us to Vulkan\u2013specific concepts. However, labs mostly consisted of following/copy\u2013pasting Vulkan code, which we were expected to use as a starting point for the projects. The projects themselves were insanely time\u2013consuming; while I learned a great deal about graphics programming, the bugs in the starter code and the back\u2013loaded schedule made it unnecessarily stressful.",
        "Lectures were long and often confusing; they were okay in terms of developing a general understanding of theory, but did not cover actual code at all. Labs were helpful in that they were then sort of baseplates for projects and there was a lot we could copy and paste from them. Supposedly, labs were when we were supposed to learn how to implement what we learned in class, but we only had 3 total (often labs were cancelled or not released because the professor hadn't finished writing them; the TAs also missed lab sessions multiple times), and the tasks varied wildly from copy and pasting code to completing a new task with minimal direction or guidance. Assignments were mostly math related, and helped to solidify understanding but were very difficult. I learned a lot from the projects, but they were ridiculously difficult. I spent a month on project 1, attending 3+ hours of office hours a week, and was unable to finish it. I didn't technically even start project 2 because I was still working on project 1, which built off of it (the source code was not posted, and it felt like we were being penalized for not finishing the first assignment far after it was due). The group projects taught me a lot, but only because I attended almost all possible office hours and asked a ridiculous amount of questions. This was actually where I learned the most about object\u2013oriented programming, the mechanics of which we didn't cover in class at all."

      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "Professor Reppy communicated at the beginning of the course that this was the first year switching from OpenGL to Vulkan, so I expected some transitional hiccups, but I was not expecting the programming component to be so terribly managed. Reppy refused to communicate any sort of grading information or standards, and despite saying to our faces that he recognized how unexpectedly difficult Vulkan programming was, gave little to no support for students that were struggling.\n\nIf all we had to do was write shaders and implement optimization techniques, then the projects would likely have been doable in the time given, but all the bookkeeping and Vulkan boilerplate necessary to manage an *entire rendering pipeline* ballooned the scope into something completely unmanageable for an undergraduate to do on top of other intense classes. This is to say nothing of the difficulty of C++ as a language and the complete nightmare that is debugging in Vulkan.\n\nUltimately the concepts were all very valuable to learn, and I'm glad I attended the lectures, but this course needs a SERIOUS overhaul of expectations before I would recommend any post\u2013154 student try it.",
        "If the projects remain the same as this year and you don't want to rewrite the starter code using a different framework, I can only recommend this course if you:\n\n\u2013 Are enrolled in three or fewer courses\n\u2013 Own a Mac or Linux machine\n\u2013 Are fluent in C++, especially with object initialization and memory management\n\u2013 Know how to use a debugger like LLDB\n\u2013 Are willing to read through thousands of lines of starter code\n\u2013 Can learn to use a new library/SDK (Vulkan) by reading the official documentation\n\u2013 Have a very strong interest in 3D video games or simulation\n\nIf you meet the above criteria, the projects COULD be a 20\u2013hour\u2013per\u2013week commitment that you will want to spend more time perfecting and improving, and this could be the best systems class you ever take. If not, the projects WILL be a never\u2013ending nightmare where you spend more time getting segfaults than actually rendering anything on the screen.",
        "This course was incredibly difficult. I put in so, so much time and never felt like my work was enough. I don't think it's reasonable to expect students (who aren't required to know object\u2013oriented programming; I didn't) to learn how to use Vulkan themselves outside of class in addition to trying to master a new coding language. This class should either have higher pre\u2013requisites than the intro sequence or be modified to have more reasonable goals, expectations, and instruction. Do not take this class unless you are prepared to prioritize it above the rest of your classes and are Very confident in your pre\u2013existing graphics and/or object\u2013orienting coding knowledge."

        "You could tell that he was excited about the subject and eager to teach us about new graphics techniques.",
        "Office hours contributed most to my learning. They were helpful if I asked specific and persistent questions, although his responses did occasionally feel condescending. His lectures were long and dry and often ran overtime. I wish he presented clear goals for our learning, discussed topics relating to the projects before assigning them (and just prepared us for our assignments in general), posted slides soon after lectures (I remember one specific instance when several students were asking if he could post the slides for a lecture that was extremely relevant to the homework, and he did not respond until after the assignment was due)."
      ],
      "What could the instructor modify to help you learn more?": [
        "Provide much more instruction & documentation on projects. Explain complex topics more clearly, and spend less time elaborating on the straightforward stuff.",
        "Literally all of it. I don't understand how he could expect us to teach ourselves Vulkan and C++, when he couldn't even provide functioning source code for our projects.",
        "Either spend less time in lecture on niche optimization strategy and more on Vulkan specifics, or seriously improve the project base library. You can't just throw a highly complicated ecosystem like Vulkan at a bunch of undergrads who have probably never worked with C++ before with only a single barebones support library.",
        "Sort out the assignment logistics earlier, as most of the issues this quarter stemmed from delays on the instructor end. Labs were not well utilized; TAs should go over the Vulkan concepts that will be introduced at the start of each session. Deadlines for homework and projects should not overlap despite there being weeks where nothing was due. Project 1 should be broken down into two smaller projects spread out over two weeks: the first asking students to implement a single pipeline to make sure they can render a scene, and the second asking them to add the remaining 3 pipelines by building off their existing framework. Finally, bugs in the starter code should be identified before a project is assigned, not two days before the deadline.",
        "I appreciated learning the theory behind what we were doing, but again, think it was unreasonable to cover literally no actual code in class. It would be very, very helpful if we did so. In general, I wish he didn't cancel labs so frequently, since those are the largest chunks of time when we can work on class material with support \u2013 I appreciate the attempt to lessen our workload, but perhaps instead, he could not release a new assignment, but leave the time as a session in which we could receive help from the TAs."

The homeworks and exam were of a reasonable difficulty, but the projects were challenging; graphics applications are inherently difficult to debug, and having to learn Vulkan is an additional hurdle on top of that.

I didn't complete a single project, and had a lot of trouble trying to master Vulkan and C++ at the same time.

It was definitely frustrating at times and could be time consuming, especially when working on the final project and on Assignment 3's Edge Collapse (this still gives me nightmares).\n\nOverall, definitely doable, but can sometimes take a surprising amount of time for debugging. Don't take this with another systems course / Theory course unless you want to have a rough quarter.",

Also, I never realized how cool floating point is.",

Also taught great systems fundamentals for building these fundamentals \u2013 such as using profilers to optimize code.\n\nNOTE: If you can, take this class. It is a time commitment, but the projects your work on are incredibly interesting. The experience you get / understanding of systems is at a level hard to get from other classes.

        "The labs were particularly helpful as the professor often gave us lots of feedback and tips on how to solve the projects.",
        "Lectures were helpful in learning the content, labs and homeworks helped to reinforce the learning, and projects were how we applied what we learned.",
        "The programming projects were excellent. They properly insulated us from needing to code our own C\u2013framework and allowed us to focus on the core formulas and computational tradeoffs relevant to scientific visualization.",
        "Online lecture recordings were good to go over especially when working on projects, and homeworks supported the core ideas of projects.",
        "Projects",
        "The professor communicated that we would use a flipped learning model in which students complete video lectures at home and discuss the content in class. However, very little discussion actually occurred in class. There were probably no more than four or five lectures that was spent actually discussing theory. The rest was spent either going over solutions, listening to students\u2019 complaints, goofing off and telling silly jokes, or musing about random philosophical topics instead of actually accomplishing anything productive or related to the material.",
        "Projects were immensely helpful understanding how color maps, isocontouring, and image rendering works because each subsequent project was built on top of the previous one. We started off with 1\u2013D visualization to 2\u2013D colormaps to 3\u2013D volume rendering and vector field visualizations. Homeworks helped grasp concepts laid out in the textbook and the pre\u2013recorded lectures, such as change of coordinate space, \"over\" operation, Blinn Phong, etc.",
        "The projects are the biggest part of this class",
        "Projects made sure you knew the material well",
        "I think the prerecordered lectures were great. The projects had a ton of pedagogical value. Homeworks were a good bridge between lectures and projects. In class lectures also were fun.",
        "Lectures were very helpful in understanding course material, and the projects, while time consuming, helped to solidify knowledge.",
        "Assignments were extremely helpful for the projects, as they basically went over concepts you needed to know in a very guided way. Projects were very guided, which was very nice if you didn't know where to start. Sometimes I would have liked a little bit more freedom during projects, but the guided nature certainly made them less daunting and doable, especially since some of the projects (specifically the third) were a bit more time consuming. Lectures were good overall, as the Professor is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter, and is very willing to answer any questions students may have. The only criticism I have is that maybe class time could be spent a little bit more efficiently.",
        "Pre\u2013recorded lectures were very well paced and informative, and reviewing was easy. Class time was more flexible and used to discuss homework and projects. It was a bit hard to focus in labs but I could generally get help when I needed it.",
        "pre recorded lectures were dense but very helpful. labs were good and the projects were gruesome but so worth it",
        "This course is set up so well! The assigned videos, FSV textbook, project descriptions, and even reference code are so detailed and well thought out. Additionally, I think the fast paced nature of the course is perfect in the sense that it's just a little overwhelming but you learn so much and know you have great support when completing the work!",
        "Lectures were useless, but attendance was required. Assignments were difficult but solidified understanding of concepts introduced in lecture videos. The only place you could get any of the course material was the lecture videos, which I didn't like. I would have preferred a traditional lecture over asynchronous ones. And good lord, the labs were painful to sit through if he was trying to show us something, since it would take him forever to explain things. Since lab was directly after class, that meant we had to sit through nearly 3.5 hours of him rambling on about something he could have explained in less than an hour. Labs were only good if he didn't try to lecture about something, as he would make his way around the room and answer questions individually. That was helpful.",
        "Labs were mostly to answer questions, in\u2013class sessions were mostly a review, but video lectures explained the content well.",
        "I got most of my learning from the lectures and the assignments.",
        "The class structure was remote learning. You watched a video lecture and then came to class to discuss learning. Homeworks were assigned bi\u2013weekly, as well as projects. Projects were involved and used cumulative learning over the quarter, homework focused on specific concepts.",
        "Super cool stuff,",
        "The ponopto videos were very helpful, labs and HW were useful but never felt entirely necessary, and lectures were just glorified office hours the never felt particularly useful (although attendance was mandatory, if it were not I probably would not have gone).",
        "Reverse classroom was extremely effective. Allowed me to study the material on my own time while making class more conversation driven."

      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "Amazing professor",
        "Prof. Kindlmann fostered an excellent learning environment and made a point of learning every students name. I felt that everyone student in the class had a voice and was welcomed to ask questions.",
        "lots of work.",
        "Suspiciously easy and atrocious teaching, if you can even call it teaching. This is a great class if you don't want to learn computer science. Otherwise, take electives with an instructor who actually believes in teaching.",
        "This class is really time consuming and pretty math heavy",
        "Great course and professor, kinda too much work",
        "Very time consuming; my work in other classes suffered.",
        "This was a great course. I wish I had gotten practice in pthreads previously though.",
        "glk is probably one of the best professors in the cs dept",
        "GLK is very nice, understanding, and helpful, but the course is in great need of organization. There were no clear goals or objectives, just projects that we had to complete. I'm pretty sure I didn't learn anything new, I just used my previous knowledge to complete assignments. It's an interesting topic and GLK is qualified, but keeping track of what we needed to do/learn in this class gave me a headache. I've looked at previous reviews for this course and they were pretty bad, but I think GLK is getting more organized. I hope next year he has everything down to a science so he can provide a less confusing class experience.",
        "You can really tell that Kindlmann cares a lot. He spends a lot of time personally assessing student work and taking the time to meet with students to help them understand the material. I've never had such a caring professor at UChicago who put so much time and effort towards resources and helping students succeed.",
        "Sometimes it felt, especially at the start of the course, that there were just too many things going on. Individually, the pedagogical value of each assignment was clear, but all together it was a bit too much. Between the lectures, ponopto videos, readings, homeworks, labs, projects, testing on both mac and linux, and rules on project collaboration, there were just too many things to be constantly keeping track of for one course."
      ],
      "Thinking about your time in the class, what aspect of the instructor's teaching contributed most to your learning?": [
        "His incredibly well\u2013developed projects; so many comments and thoughts. You can tell he really put a lot of effort into making the class accessible.",
        "The way he engaged with the students and his openness to questions helped a lot.",
        "Prof. Kindlmann was able to build a small community that we all felt comfortable participating in. I think this made the biggest impact as it made studying the topic fun and rewarding. Practically speaking, the prerecorded lectures were also a fantastic resource. Rating: 11 / 11.",
        "Very organized and very responsive to student's questions and how to navigate the codebase.",
        "The instructor was very thorough in answering questions.",
        "GLK's willingness to listen to student feedback and improve how he structured projects/lectures were immensely helpful and admirable. For example, after project 1, he asked the class what could be improved and some students said it would be beneficial to have a timeline as to which parts of the project should be finished by when. The next project, he took our feedback and posted a timeline for us, which helped guide us through our projects efficiently. Overall, GLK is awesome. He's willing to listen, he's funny, and extremely knowledgeable about visualizations.",
        "In class idscussions",
        "Lectures and providing us with some basic guidelines for how to start the projects were good. Professor Kindlmann is incredibly kind. I think going to office hours to ask questions is super valuable use of time. He can also be pretty funny.",
        "The instructor's pre\u2013recorded lectures were the most important contribution to my learning, as they allowed me to consistently re\u2013reference the lecture material while working on the projects.",
        "Professor Kindlmann is great at helping students regardless of their level, and is very easy to approach/talk to and ask any question. Class time is a discussion section to go over the lecture which is great if you need a little bit of extra reinforcement.",
        "Pre\u2013recorded lectures and slides. The professor was also great at answering questions and checking in how the class was doing.",
        "glk took the time to address everyones questions always. he also learned all 50 of our names, something you don't usually get in a cs class. he was very understanding when it came to deadlines, and was a great teacher overall",
        "Professor Kindlmann was one of the best professors I've had here at UChicago!",
        "I attended every class, and I don't think a single one contributed to my learning. They were very disorganized and he made the slides as class progressed. Sometimes, he opened up for questions which was helpful, but this was not always the case.",
        "Pre\u2013recorded lectures, answering many questions in class",
        "He was willing to put in time to make sure that we understood the material and didn't fall behind in the course.",
        "Extremely beneficial. GLK is a top\u2013tier professor at this institution. He has a true passion for his discipline/teaching \u2013 although this class takes time you will get so much out of it. He put an incredible amount of effort into each project, as well as the notes (he pretty much wrote his own textbook for this course), and the lecture videos.\n\nThe lecture videos probably contribute the most since that's where the actual information is conveyed.",
        "Taking the time to make excellent pre\u2013recorded lectures as well as slides in class to review the material, help with projects, etc. Also really liked the many open discussions which taught us more about various important concepts.",
        "ponopto videos",
        "Gordon's prep work behind the scenes clearly stands out in how well\u2013organized all his programming assignments were and how consistently they were structured. Clearly demarcating where the student code is meant to go and having thorough on demand testing made working on all the assignments allowed me to focus much more on the material than stress out over breaking existing frameworks or setting up environments."
      ],
      "What could the instructor modify to help you learn more?": [
        "Maybe providing a bit more resources and/or examples for us to look through before the projects.",
        "Since course time was more discussion based, it may have made sense to have a set of problems to go over each lecture. This was done for several class periods and I felt the time was used well.",
        "Project 3a is a significant step up in work, and understanding everything you're supposed to do is hard.",
        "Use class time productively, and actually go over concepts. Foster a more inclusive environment.",
        "This was a flipped classroom so we had pre\u2013recorded lectures to cover content and class time was spent discussing solutions to projects and homework, asking general questions, etc. While class time was relatively chill and definitely a break from some of my other courses, personally, I would have preferred regular lectures over a flipped classroom, as this would make more efficient use of class time.",
        "Not much",
        "I think the organization of the projects is the most ripe area for improvement. It was often hard to find information that might help with a particular section because there were like 4 different possible places key information could be. Is it in the header comments? The FSV? Edstem? The prerecorded lecture? Finding a way to consolidate the information or make it more easily findable would save students a lot of time, stress, and heartache.",
        "Make the class less time consuming. It's unreasonable to expect students to be spending 20\u201330 hours outside of lectures/homework on a single class.",
        "Students can sometimes be anxious talking in front of the whole class, so maybe smaller discussion sections could be nice. I like the idea of having a discussion section, but I think that it would work a lot better with a smaller headcount so that everyone feels more at ease and can contribute more to the conversation.",
        "Maybe the grading could be paced a bit better. And sometimes it wasn't clear what we were doing in the actual class time. Ed was a more useful platform for discussion than the actual physical classroom.",
        "nothing",
        "Perhaps this is unpopular, but I really prefer in\u2013person lectures. With the format GLK went with this quarter, we watched lectures outside of class and then were required to come to class. It really was the worst of both worlds (virtual and in\u2013person). I get what he was trying to do\u2013\u2013which was give us the chance to rewatch videos if we didn't understand\u2013\u2013but it just didn't contribute anything towards my learning. I really think this was the most disorganized course I have taken at UChicago. I'm not sure we even learned anything new, we just used previous knowledge of math/cs to create images. I would have appreciated a clearer overview of what we were going to learn. That being said, GLK was helpful for the most part outside of class (although he was kind of MIA for a couple weeks at the beginning on EdStem). It was just the classes themselves that were very unhelpful and a waste of 80 minutes.",
        "Relate lectures to the projects a bit more",
        "It would be helpful to receive faster feedback on all the graded assignments.",
        "Some of the write\u2013ups are so long it can be a bit hard to understand exactly what is wanted for each function/project. I think writing this in a structured format on the website as opposed to in C comments would help a lot \u2013 then what was expected, and what we should do could be emphasized/framed better.",

        "I took only the CS intro courses and found this course quite challenging, but very doable.",

        "Not 'difficult' but a LOT of work",
        "I took this class knowing it would be hard, having read previous years course evals. I knew I would have to learn some math principles outside of class and devote a lot of hours in Crerar to it, but I found it generally pretty worth it and fun.",
        "This course is incredibly difficult; a partner is absolutely necessary on all projects, and you should be budgeting 20\u201330 hours per project.",
        "Moderately challenging, however the main difficulty is the time commitment. If you're willing to put in the work, I'd say the class is very doable.",
        "I liked the physics notations in the theoretical part of this class. Getting a partner is great if you are bad at pacing yourself for projects. There was a lot of coding and that stressed me during the busy parts of the quarter but it was fun and the results were very cool. C proficiency helps but if you took 152 you'll survive. I think I now know how pointers actually work.",
        "it's very interesting stuff, but be ready to work. the workload peaks in the middle of the quarter and then starts getting easier again",
        "Definitely, DEFINITELY need background in C. I know this is something everyone will already have from the intro sequence, but if you weren't paying attention during 152/154, you're out of luck for this course. Other than that, not too difficult",
        "The course was challenging but not super difficult with basic linear algebra background knowledge.",
        "CAAM / CS \u2013 definitely understandable but a large time commitment. The labs are some of the coolest projects I've worked on but lord did they take some time to complete. Definitely doable for any CS major.",
        "Be prepared to spend a good amount of time on this class debugging silly things, but it will make you a better programmer and problem solver. You will learn a lot in this class and Kindlmann is an excellent professor.",
        "very accessible, although the extra credit is easier if you have taken Computer Architecture as knowing how a processer works will give you an advantage when writing fast code.",

        "The class was good overall, I just wish that assignments had been graded in a timelier manner. It's the end of week 9, and out of about 10 assignments, 2 have been graded.",
        "This class was extremely disorganized \u2013 Professor Kindlmann was very inconsistent in posting assignments on time, often releasing them upwards of a week late. Grading was incredibly slow \u2013 as the final, only two assignments (out of more than ten) had been graded. Professor Kindlmann is a very nice person and is clearly an expert in the field, and the class has great potential \u2013 the projects and (prepared\u2013for) lectures were very well designed. Unfortunately, things started to fall apart around week 4/5, where assignments stopped being released according to schedule and EdStem posts were only erratically answered at best. From talking to people who had taken the class in the past and reading previous evaluations, this seems to have been the case every year. This year's class was probably a slight improvement from previous iterations (in which the class was de\u2013facto cancelled midway through), but I do not understand how it still isn't fully fleshed out after so many years.",
        "We did not really receive grades on assignments, but I am very grateful to how much the professor went over assignments beforehand, so that we could succeed on our projects.",
        "I hate coding but the more theoretical parts of the class were interesting, which made this course enjoyable overall. glk's also a really chill dude. he's really willing to engage with students, so definitely go to his office hours if you have a question or curiosity about something. this class was one of my most memorable classes to date because of how approachable glk was.",
        "Of the 7 hw assignments, 4 projects, and 1 midterm we were assigned, by the end of finals week we had hw1 and p3 graded\u2013\u2013nothing else. GLK is a nice guy, tries to learn everyones name, is a pleasant person to talk to casually/in labs, but he was just so disorganized. the projects were well designed but the slow grading/lack of feedback, slow responses on ed, rushed hws, shifting due dates, and slow communication really undercut all that. lectures were fine but kind of dull and unnecessary for success in the class. you could tell GLK really likes this stuff, I just wish it came through more. the lectures always had the feeling like we were just doing a wuick summary then we'd move on to the interesting part but then 80 minutes later we'd still be in this summary phase and we'd walk out wondering what we'd learned and why it took so long to get there.",

We were only asked to create the best visualization we could (without exactly following a template) one time for half a project. The rest of the tasks were either basic assignments to prove we did the readings, evaluations of visualizations, or recreations of existing visualizations. To actually learn to integrate data visualization theory with the practice of creating visualizations, we should actually create visualizations from scratch and then receive feedback on them. By the time we took the final, 1/7 homeworks, 0/1 midterms, and 1/4 projects were graded"

Homework assignments were mixed. Some were reasonable and made it obvious as to what we were supposed to understand. Other times, the questions didn't align with what we'd learned yet in lecture and made no sense as to why they were on the homework at that point.",

TA recitation should be helpful but the content was not so related to the assignment.

The last homework was copying some guy's personal blog.\nLectures are fine, but I think Willett is definitely the stronger lecturer. However, she tends to spend half of class time reviewing the previous lecture, to the point it feels redundant. You're better off watching the previous years recorded lectures.",

The TA sessions were not well run (silent, awkward, minimal instruction, dubious relevance to the course). Lectures were detailed and speedy to the point of sometimes being VERY stressful; accordingly, having past years' recordings was key. Homeworks definitely improved my understanding but were hugely time\u2013consuming in a way the instructors don't seem to understand.",

        "Rarely have I had such mixed feelings about a class. On one had, both Prof. Jonas and Prof. Willett very effective lecturers (some of the best I've had for a \"STEM\" related class). On the other hand, the content of the lectures and the homeworks diverged substantially.\n\nSome particularly grueling bits of the homework were actually answered in\u2013full in prior year's recorded lectures (I spent half a day putting together a bad proof for power iteration, before finding out that it is covered in its entirety in a recorded lecture from 2020, but was cut entirely from this year's in\u2013person lectures). I'd honesty be 100% OK with having some assigned pre\u2013recorded videos. I get that the shortened quarter has made it difficult to fit everything in.",
        "Lectures at times didn't provide the motivation for certain ML methods, but rather focused on putting equations on the board for us to work with later in the homework. For example, it was explained that kernel methods translate data into higher dimensions with no context as to why this was so important or powerful. A quick Youtube video gave this understanding to me instead.\nOther than this, lectures were helpful but moved fairly slowly, given the disparity in mathematical know\u2013how among students. I often found myself learning more from the lecture notes posted by Professor Willett on Canvas instead. Homework was effective at deepening understanding, but homework was often out of the scope of lecture, which meant a lot of time spent self\u2013learning.",
        "Homework assignments (the ones where you didn't have to code) were the most helpful",

        "The lecture notes were not always helpful for understanding the homework/lectures. The lecture notes were from a different year, so there were many times when a topic taught in class was not covered at the same level of depth in the lecture notes. This made completing assignments more difficult.\n\nMost of the understanding I needed to complete the assignments was gained through the Ed Discussion board. The TAs were great!",

        "The dissertations weren't very helpful",
        "The lectures gave a (bad) overview of machine learning"
      ],
      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "Please update the assignments if the content of the last half of class changes. I can't understand the point of doing homework that is completely not related to what we discuss in lectures. We have to watch recordings and notes from previous years to figure out homework questions.",
        "After the midterm, the material seems to have gone at a slower pace than the class was originally designed. However, the assignments were still at the regular schedule. Thus, there were some concepts in assignments that weren't covered at all in lecture, but the online lecture notes and videos were helpful for those.\n\nThe first half of the course (before the midterm) wasn't too hard, but some of the assignments after the midterm were extremely difficult. I felt like I spent more time just figuring out what the problem is asking for and comparatively very little time actually doing the problem.",
        "The course material was interesting, but the administrative choices of the course made it an overall negative experience. First, grading. Homework assignments were not graded in a timely manner. We had 7 homework assignments in total, and only 4 were graded up by the time of the final. This made it difficult to understand how well you were doing in the class and how you should plan your time. For example, we had an optional extra credit assignment. The assignment itself was quite long, and it was difficult to decide whether or not to actually complete the extra credit since we didn't know our current standing in the course.\nSecond, the TA sessions. TAs seemed like they had some degree of ownership over what material to cover in their sessions. In the last session leading up to the final, some TAs chose to go over the answers to the practice final while others decided to focus on other topics entirely. This might have been okay if not for the fact that they didn't release solutions to the practice final. I truly do not understand the motivation behind this decision. It felt like it actively harmed my learning and was overall detrimental to my preparation for the final.\nThird, the quality of explanations to homeworks and topics. Linear algebra is not a prerequisite for this course, yet some homework answer keys utilized a deeper understanding of linear algebra beyond the scope of this course. Some of the TAs at several times also seemed unable to explain concepts in a simple way, and often fell back on using jargon and external knowledge to convey concepts.",
        "The only thing I did not like is the lecture switch up mid quarter. Professor Jonas is a great teacher, I just don't think the class admin properly handled the handoff as in class lectures seemed to deviate from the recorded lectures, and the homeworks eventually became slightly more up to pace than what we were covering in lectures.",
        "Independently, both Professor Jonas and Willett are great as lecturers. But switching professors halfway through the quarter was problematic. The transition wasn't smooth \u2013 it seemed like we got an extra week of SVD and missed out on other key concepts that were recorded in previous year's lectures, making it difficult understand what we should be taking away from class and why we weren't covering the same topics as years prior. We also got out of alignment on the homework questions and were doing homework assignments on topics we hadn't learned about yet which was difficult.",
        "The lectures in this class did not match up with the assignments or exams at all. What we learned in lecture was almost never helpful for doing the homework. People posted about this problem multiple times on edstem but they never changed anything",
        "Homework is a little bit difficult",
        "Overall, I learned a lot in this course. One aspect the instructors could improve would be the continuity between previous years lectures and the live lectures. Sometimes I felt like students who did not go to class had an advantage over students who attended live lectures since the prerecorded videos covered more material.",
        "I feel like they are trying to pander to too large of an audience with this course. They dont require linear algebra, teach a shotgun version of it, and then teach concepts that are out of the scope of the class (i.e. not teaching row echelon or things like that, but then using eigenvalues as justification for certain properties.",
        "a very useful course in terms of getting a foundation in the methods of machine learning",
        "Linear algebra should be a prerequisite, no question. So many homework questions involve understanding of eigenvalue decomposition, linear independence, bases and subspaces that I can't imagine how to do them if I hadn't taken lin alg. Overall, this class felt lazily put together and lacked oversight. It seemed like these professors were so used to teaching it in the past they put no effort into writing decent homework and test questions. Also the distribution of material is odd; the first half of the course is learning least squares. The latter half is learning the rest of the topics. The staff is very defensive towards student complaints on Ed, or they don't acknowledge them at all. Someone is asleep behind the wheel.",
        "Since the cours was co taught by 2 instructors, and the transition to 2nd instructor happens midway through a very critical topic SVD which is the bedrock for success in the course after midterm assignment, the transition by Prof Eric should have been handled better. I had to basically stop attending live lecture classes after I saw the instruction in his 1st class. Linear algebra requires a written instruction approach which explains the math and intuition of the derivations, and also explains the motivation behind where this particular topic gets used in real life application, and why is an algorithm better or worse than the previous algorithms taught in the course (i.e the value add). Prof Willett was 10/10 on this aspect because she was writing everything systematically after explaining the intuition of the math. However, Prof. Eric was somewhat unstructured and there were lot of gaps between what he taught versus what the recorded videos of Prof Willett from previous years taught. The inconsistency in his approach was echoed constantly on the Ed discussions. This adversely affected my time spent on this course because I had 2 watch 2 years of lecture videos on the same topics because even they didnt overlap 100% and after that I would have to check with Prof. Eric's class notes and my conclusion was that Prof. Eric's class notes were a subset. I appreciate the design of the final exam which was intended to assess whether students intuitively understood the concept or not, rather than testing us on who can do complex linear algebra proofs in the class.",
        "I understand that it can be hard to predict the flow of the quarter, but it seems like Becca has this course down pat after doing it for several years \u2013 and yet we were not even close to finishing up the material when the quarter ended. In particular, we ended up spending a lot of time on LS and its variants and missing out on a lot of the exciting machine learning payoff at the end of the syllabus. It would be worth reevaluating how to avoid that issue in future years.\n\nMy other comment is that this course should absolutely NOT have the casual barriers to entry it does now. I am a second\u2013year CAPP student who took linear algebra and machine learning last year, and yet simply completing the assignments routinely took me the entire weekend. Students with less preparation (specifically: no linear algebra background, little or no python) must have felt terribly overcome. The course is described as being open to beginners, and the first two problem sets are so much easier and quicker than the subsequent ones, that I'm sure some students decided to give it a go and were subsequently in a very tough spot.",
        "I enjoyed this class enormously and would definitely recommend it to my peers. One complaint is that I felt the problem sets could have been better tailored to test our conceptual understanding of the material. I have comfortable with Python and didn't necessary \"struggle\" to finish the homeworks, but I did find myself wondering, \"what is this testing me on?\"\n\nI think I would have learned more if the homeworks leaned into proofs and conceptual questions rather than coding problems.",
        "Homeworks are really poorly designed and take way too long. Please fix the starter code on them and make it more clear why we are doing things. A basic guide to matplotlib in a discussion section or something wouldn't hurt either.",
        "I do like the fact that the homeworks are most of the grade, as opposed to everything resting on the final.\n\nHowever, if we could get our grades back on those homeworks in a more timely manner, that would be nice.",
        "The course definitely felt disorganized at times. Homework covered topics not covered in lectures. Lectures ran behind schedule at some point in the quarter, and TAs didn't seem to always know what we had or hadn't learned, which meant recitation sections sometimes assumed knowledge we didn't yet have. As a math double major, I felt that some concepts weren't explained rigorously enough for strong understanding, but I understand that the timeline for the course might not have allowed for deeper explanations. However, as a result, this became a sort of plug and chug class.\nNonetheless, the concepts and methods I learned are extremely valuable and I'm glad I took this class.",
        "I believe that the change in instructor negatively affected the quality of the course. Not sure what happened but it seems that there was miscommunication on what Professor Willett covered on the first half of the class, because there was a mismatch on the lectures and homeworks after that, as a result I had to rely on previous years recordings to keep up with problem sets.",
        "Pretty poorly run. Too much dependence on TAs and many fundamental ideas in machine learning are skipped.",
        "There was some disconnect between the lectures and the material on the homework assignments.",
        "I want to share a single anecdote that encapsulates what it was like to take this class. In one assignment, the instructors literally linked an entire Wikipedia page and told the students to implement what was there. A student posted on Ed expressing concern about the lectures and the assignments not being consistent, and one of the instructors responded to the post with, \"It is typical for university\u2013level courses to expect students to learn material not covered explicitly in lectures.\"\n\nAssignments are very frustrating, and it doesn't seem like the instructors are likely to change course. Save yourself the frustration and take another class."

I don't have any complaints on that front.\n\nHowever, a single hour of office\u2013hours, at 9:00am on a Monday morning, is not really sufficient for 250 person class.\n\nI do apreciate the number of TA sessions.

Also, their responses on Ed were sometimes vague, so if they could be more clear on what they mean, that would be nice. Finally, there were many concepts on assignments that were not discussed at all in lectures, so it would be very helpful if the instructors covered those concepts in lectures.",
        "Better alignment between lecture content, homework assignments, and exams. After going to every lecture, there were times when I still didn't fully understand what a homework assignment was asking me until I watched the prerecorded lecture content. This effectively doubled the workload for this course.",

I understand that the practice exams and actual exams were very similar, so providing a complete solution would have made it \"too easy,\" but in my view, that is not good reasoning. The lack of solutions meant that we would have to ask TAs, speak to peers, etc. and hope that we got the answer right. There were some questions that I solved, but didn't have the chance to verify and when they appeared on the final (in a similar form), I felt nervous that maybe my initial solution was wrong. All in all, the lack of solutions create a lot of frustration and wasted time that could be avoided with a more diversified question bank.\n\nAs a graduate student, I felt that the project was more of a chore than a learning opportunity. This is especially so because my team spent more time cleaning the data than analyzing it. I would advise that the course do away with the project or at the very least, ask for a \"conceptual\" project rather than an applied one.",
        "Closer coordination between homework content and lecture content.",
        "I think it would be helpful for the instructors to motivate the problem solved by each ML method first, as opposed to diving straight into equations. Understanding why each ML method is so powerful makes it so much more exciting to learn. This was done well for hinge loss, for example, because the problem with standard least squares in binary classification was explained first. However, I had no idea why we were projecting data onto higher dimensional spaces with kernels or why kernel functions were so powerful until I looked it up myself.",
        "This course is messy, and the change in curriculum felt pretty reckless. Firstly, there should be a linear algebra pre\u2013requisite. Second, the homework questions should more accurately reflect the material that's being taught (it became frustrating when the profs decided to alter what they were teaching, but they continued to recycle old hw questions). I also still feel super lost with notation in class..",
        "Improve communication with the rest of the team. Sometimes TA in discussions didn't know what was covered in class that week.",
        "It is pretty weird that assignments are due at 11 PM on a weekend instead of the usual midnight on a weekday. The professors were incredibly unavailable (strictly opposed emails, forced TA communication on Ed (if you wanted to appeal something to a prof instead of a TA, there is no clear way to do this), and had one office hour session at 9 AM). Other problems besides that are difficult to think about because I feel like a lot of them are related to how ML is a field rather than something inherently bad about the instructors. There is no clear explanation of what the goal of machine learning is; the first class mentioned this (alongside ideas of bias/ethics in AI that we literally never came back to), but after the first week there was little to no explanation of the motivation behind the more nuanced math ideas. This felt like a baby numerical analysis class on just the least squares problem. I know that some kids don't know linear algebra but instead of over\u2013simplifying important stuff, staff should just make linear algebra a prerequisite. Only materials from other universities e.g. CMU and MIT tended to be substantially better to learn from. Lectures are hard to listen to and staff should follow a motivation\u2013>definition\u2013>example format like the math department's classes, rather than the less structured approach done by the CS department (which works for programming, but not for ML, imo).",

        "assignments were challenging and lectures were mostly helpful, discussion sections were also usually helpful",
        "Bad. Lectures were too fast and uninteresting. Felt like we were just watching a video on 2x speed.",
        "Prof. Willett was an incredible teacher. I especially appreciated having access to past years' recorded lectures.",
        "Lectures were good for learning, and recitations were good for sitting next to my crush",
        "Lectures were incredible.",
        "Lectures are well designed and fast paced (not really a problem since they are also recorded). The TA sessions are horrible. I am new to the topic and was relying on TA sessions to help me through, especially the coding sections. The TAs hardly ever got to the coding in time and even when they did, the read the code like a stream of consciousness and left it at that. Even office hours were a nightmare. Students chosen as TAs were clearly underqualified to teach other students, even if they may have done well in the class themselves. Assignments were far too long and outside of what was covered in class and took far too long. The final assignment was 10% and also required a lot more work than it was worth. But it was also constrained enough that we did not really learn anything new or of value in doing it as grad students who want to understand how methods are applied.",
        "Rebecca's recorded lectures were by far the biggest resource I used. Hw's were useful to learn application.",
        "The lectures were quite informative. Homework assignments were mostly helpful, but some questions (especially the coding assignments) were a bit lengthy and required extensive setup before actually doing the machine learning part.",
        "I really liked Eric's lectures. Rebecca was also good and her notes were very clear.",
        "The lectures are extremely helpful, and the homework is well designed.",
        "Lectures were hard to follow in\u2013person: classroom was big, boards were small. But previously recorded lectures were quite good, as well as online notes. Did not attend lecture in\u2013person past the first week.",
        "Lectures were almost completely unrelated to the homework, without background in linear algebra be prepared to teach yourself every relevant aspect of it because they wont. Discussion sections help with homework slightly, though their material is not available online.",
        "lectures were pretty useful and assignments reinforced the concepts, but discussion sections weren't too useful",
        "lecture videos from previous year help A LOT. STRONGLY RECOMMEND WATCHING",
        "the lectures were well taught and ther ecitation sessions helped with clearing many doubts",
        "The lectures by both professors (Willett and Jonas) were great. The recorded lectures online were extremely helpful in reviewing the material (https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/teaching/mathematical\u2013foundations\u2013of\u2013machine\u2013learning\u2013fall\u20132021/). I would recommend that every class records and uploads its lectures like this",
        "\u2013 Extensive online resources including full recorded lectures from 2 previous years\n\u2013 generally theoretical portions of the psets were very strong\n\u2013 implementations in Python\n\u2013 lecture quality was good",
        "The most helpful element of this course was the PSets; they helped make concepts concrete.",
        "Lectures were entirely unrelated to homeworks. TAs were annoyed to be TAing and were terse and unhelpful on Ed. The professors turn off posting on Ed the day before the exam. The homeworks forced you to learn though.",
        "Lecture helped introduce material (though they provided recordings of previous year's lectures, so I probably could've gotten away with skipping it & watching those instead). Recitation section was meant to go over some of the more difficult aspects. Homework assignments were mainly to solidify our understanding of lecture material",
        "Lectures, for the most part, were clear and thorough. The online notes and previous lecture recordings are an excellent resource. Assignments were hit or miss in enhancing the material, as some questions were quite unclear in what they were asking or the questions were on material not even tangentially covered in lecture. But, other questions were great in applying the material. Discussions could be more organized as different TAs covered different material, all to various degrees of relevance and/or helpfulness to assignments and practice exams.",
        "I felt lectures were generally well\u2013polished and useful, and the time expectations from this course were very reasonable. I thought the tests were fair and I generally enjoyed learning this material. I think one or two of the homeworks need some work, as they were a bit inconsistent in the time expectation. Especially homeworks 4 and 5 were far longer than the prior 3 or the next few, and that inconsistency was a problem for turning in quality work. I also felt like the instructions on some of the homework questions could have been more clearly written.",
        "Access to instructor notes, and previous years lectures were helpful. Lectures were very well taught and enjoyable to attend.",
        "While the lectures were interesting and covered important topics, it was far too removed from what we were being asked to do in The lectures and the homework.",
        "Lectures were generally engaging and well organized. Sometimes I wish they went a little faster to cover more material, but with 250 students, there's a large variability in background knowledge. Assignments at the beginning of the quarter reflected lectures well, but there was a significant divergence in the second half of the quarter. Problem sets were not super well\u2013written during the second half.",
        "lectures (expecially notes and recorded videos) are very helpful for me to review the details; labs (contained in assignments) pave the way to put what we learned into practice",
        "Lectures were generally pretty good. Professor Willett was a slightly better lecturer than Professor Jonas, but both were clear and very willing to answer questions. Discussion sections were largely useless and should not have been added to the course in my opinion (previous versions of the course didn't have them apparently). The TAs seemed to have a written agenda that they followed. I feel like this agenda should have just been posted online so that we didn't have to waste our time attending the discussion sections (the content we learned there wasn't helpful for the rest of the course anyway). Assignments were kind of a mixed bag. Homeworks 1\u20134 were pretty good and related to the course content well. But in the last couple of assignments, we started being given problems that had no relationship to the course content, presumably so that we could learn more stuff. But in the mean time, what was being taught in class wasn't getting reinforced. We really should have had some homework problems on the hinge loss and SVMs (and more homework problems on kernel methods). The last assignment in particular was ridiculous. It was just copying from a blog and doing multiplication and addition. I honestly felt disrespected by how much it wasted my time. I learned absolutely nothing about neural networks by reading that blog. I just learned to blindly follow this dude's calculations.",
        "Lecture were helpful I guess and the notes they gave us were goated for understanding what's going on.",
        "Professor Willett's lecture and past recordings are super helpful! Some of the TAs' sections and OH are also instructive.",
        "The lectures were good, many of the TA office hours were good as well. I just wish the assignments were more connected to the class material.",
        "Homeworks helpful in solidifying the content learned in lecture, though they added in a programming aspect. The exams seemed to disconnect a bit from the homeworks, as they just mirrored the practice exams closely but were not focused on the theoretical aspects of the course as much. Rather, they were a very simplified version of the homeworks.",
        "Prof. Willett was very keen on letting us understand the math in very easy fashion. Prof. Jonas was more focused on presenting than breaking down the math. But they were both very helpful. The assignments expanded the class materials a lot.",
        "Each week there were 2 lectures, 1 discussion section, and many office hours available. The course also used the ed platform, which generally had quick responses from course staff.",
        "Lectures were good. Professors were very good at answering questions and clarifying. Assignments contributed to learning overall, but sometimes seemed disconnected from the topics discussed in lecture.",
        "Prof. Rebecca Willet's video recorded lectures are a treasure trove. Some of the best introduction to the underlying math behind ML all over the internet \u2013 she's a phenomenal professor and has a gift for teaching. Unfortunately, that's where the best aspects of the course end. I wasn't too enthused by the unbelievably crowded live in\u2013person lectures, as I mostly felt overwhelmed amongst so many students and could only sometimes hear the lecturer well. The recitation sessions were pretty bad \u2013 as the TAs seemed almost disinterested in teaching and would rather have us just read the short answers from their solutions and understand the concepts ourselves. Some of the assignment problems seemed deliberately obtuse under the garb of making the students explore the vast world of math for ML. Lastly, the utter lack of clarity about what constitutes a good graduate project was a huge handicap \u2013 as we never were sure about how much time and effort to invest and what level of complexity to target for the project.",
        "Psets were pretty helpful, lectures were less so."
      ],
      "Additional comments about the course:": [
        "lecture material didn't always align with assignment material, ed was a huge mess, assignments were not returned in a reasonable time",
        "I did not like the two\u2013instructor set up. I did not feel respected or valued as a participant. You NEED to have linear algebra background to be successful in the course. It is silly not to have that as a requirement.",
        "I wish they graded things faster so I could have gotten a better sense of what sort of level they wanted to be done on the hw.",
        "This class is pretty challenging, especially if you don't have a linear algebra background. It moves really quickly as you get to the later half of the course.",
        "Instructors expect \"10 hours per [weekly] assignment\" so be prepared for that. What makes this even more frustrating is that the course material is very cool and I genuinely like the field, but the teaching of the class at high\u2013abstraction formalized math and the implementation being python code is so at odds.",
        "There's an inconsistency between lectures and assignments because of co\u2013teach and 9\u2013week quarter schedule. The content is great, but there was quite some struggles on getting the homework done and figuring out what to expect in the exams",
        "This is the most POORLY ORGANIZED course that I've seen at UChicago. By its very construction, the course faces an unsolvable dilemma \u2013 trying to teach linear algebra without actually teaching linear algebra. The result is that the 1/2 of the class that has taken linear algebra is bored for half of the course and the 1/2 of the class that has not taken linear algebra is confused from the very beginning. The lectures are extremely superficial on linear algebra, which makes many of the problems in the homework and exams not make sense to students without prior knowledge. Furthermore, the office hours just make things worse because the TAs explain concepts at an extremely sophisticated level that requires an understanding of linear algebra. So students who haven't taken that class can't even benefit from the office hours. The TAs in office hours don't receive answers so just spend the entire session trying to figure out how to solve and explain the problems.\n\nThe result is that they end up confused on basic concepts that are taught in linear algebra but just glossed over in the course.\n\nStudents who have taken linear algebra are bored because around 50% of the material in the class is a repeat.\n\nSome of the homeworks were excessively and unnecessarily long. On the other hand, other homeworks were extremely short and did not ask any questions about key concepts in the course, thus not providing students any opportunity to engage with key material. The homework questions seem repeated from previous years, which is why some homeworks (like homeworks 6 and 7) did not ask about this year's material. The practice final exam was a repeat of old questions and thus was not useful at all.\n\nMy recommendation:\na. Make this a linear algebra class like STAT 24300 with a little more focus on machine learning.\nb. Make this a machine learning class that requires a basic understanding of linear algebra, allowing you to condense the first half of the course on least squares into ~ 2 weeks of review.",
        "\u2013 Difficulty depends heavily on your background. If this is your first time doing a dedicated linear algebra course, it will be more challenging because the linear algebra is fast and the course is trying to get to other topics. Not impossible (and I think still worth it), but it will certainly be a more challenging class.\n\u2013 In my opinion, this class is at its absolute best for people who have taken Abstract Linear Algebra and are comfortable with NumPy. Abstract does not cover enough to really pick up Machine Learning smoothly, but it does cover enough to make the early part of this course a gentle review of linear algebra, then an extremely fun foray into Applied linear algebra. Numerical Linear Algebra is also good, but might make more elements of this course redundant, especially if you've already seen the SVD.",
        "While I learned a lot in this class and enjoyed the material, it was incredibly poorly organized from a logistical standpoint.",
        "Eric Jonas pretends to be friendly by talking about his child and his family, but he was broadly unfair and a poor course administrator. He denied my friend, who was in the ER all day investigating a potential appendicitis or kidney stone, even one day of an extension. My friend then spent another night taking a diuretic and trying to pass said kidney stone. He had to urinate through a sieve so that he could send the kidney stone to a lab. Jonas justified this by saying \"well, if I give you an extension then I have to give everyone an extension.\" He suggested that he use his \"drop,\" which is still a severe penalization.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why this is particularly disappointing and unfair. Firstly, does Eric Jonas think that everyone had a kidney stone that Thursday. Professors are authorized to use discretion when granting extensions. This is very poor discretion. He could have qualified such an extension by limiting the criteria to students suffering severe and acute medical emergencies.\n\nSecondly, professor Jonas seems to be discriminating on the basis of a temporary disability. The lack of any effort to find a reasonable accommodation demonstrates his lack of care for students.\n\nMy recommendation is that if you plan to take this class, don't get sick. If you get sick, don't count on professor Jonas caring.\n\nAgain: Don't get sick. For any reason.\n\n\nThe course was also poorly administered on the part of Jonas, Willet and the TAs. There are too many examples to list. One issue was that the lectures were not connected to a majority of the HW problems. One post on Ed got 60 likes just pointing this out. Another issue in the course were that, many (but not all) of the TAs were extraordinarily terse and/or unwilling to answer question. I was very surprised by the lack of motivation on the TAs part.\n\n\nMost egregious, however, was that the day before the final (around 7 hours or so before the final to be specific, which was at 8PM), Jonas (presumably) turned off all commenting and posting on Ed. I would assume his justification would be that this was to reduce the questions being asked to TAs since they have finals. This is asinine. First of all, the army of 7 TAs could have distributed questions so that no one was overburdened. The TAs are paid University employees. Secondly, students can answer each others questions on Ed. It was bizarre to see the Ed page closed on the day before a final. I don't know what the intent was.\n\nAdmittedly, I think Willet is a very good professor and was good at explaining things. And although I think more effort could have been put into updating notes, slides, and coordinating with TAs, at least I think she meant well. She is at the top of her department and busy. I have no idea why Jonas managed the course the way he did.",
        "Like I previously mentioned, I really don't think that attending lecture is necessary for success (as long as you watch the lecture videos). I'm still waiting for grades for homework I submitted nearly 4 weeks ago, which is frustrating",
        "The professor and TAs were stubborn and were not willing to listen to student's suggestions at all. They only tried so hard to argue back rather than reflect and modify.",
        "More so about the final and the registrar, but an 8pm final is unacceptable. This cannot be done again for many reasons (way too late in the day to be mentally alert, student safety, ruins the entire day, etc.).\n\nWhile it is a foundations course, covering more modern techniques would be very helpful and help students gain an idea of what other courses in the sequence will cover more in depth.",
        "The course was pretty good and fairly well\u2013polished, I don't have many suggestions to improve it.",
        "The class was being somewhat updated this year, but I definitely think that the homework content should be revised to match the lectures. As someone with no linear algebra experience (which this course allowed), the homeworks took me an unbelievable amount of time and I essentially had to learn all of the content out of class.",
        "This was a very large course (120 people per section, so 240 people total), which made it worse in my view. I'm not sure how many of the issues were caused just by it being a large course. I think it was difficult for the TAs and professors to coordinate with each other, and this may have been to blame for the homework assignments sometimes not lining up with course content.\n\nThis was unfortunately one of those courses where the professors seemed to be pointlessly against the students. They were very nice during lecture, but their actions didn't line up. Some annoying things:\n\u2013After multiple requests to post the notes for lectures online (they did them via iPad so it would have been the easiest thing in the world for the notes to be exported), the TAs just directed us to the notes for last year's lectures, which were not the same (why did the professors refuse to post this year's? who knows, there was no transparency, they didn't even respond to the Ed posts)\n\u2013Professors ignored Ed posts where people asked for improvements to be made (this was very rude imo, these posts should have for sure been addressed given the number of likes they received)\n\u2013Notes sheets that we were allowed to bring to the midterm were subsequently shredded (they should have been returned to us at a later date, no good reason for them to be gotten rid of when we could use them to make our finals preparation easier; it's not like getting rid of them really meant people lost the notes since they could have taken pictures or made a copy \u2013 it just means they had to waste time writing it down again)\n\u2013Professors were excessively cagey about what would and wouldn't be included on the final. And then the final exam itself was really poorly designed, as it wasn't very representative of the course content overall. There was also a problem on something that Professor Jonas said wouldn't be included on the final.",
        "If you have not taken linear algebra don't take this class this is just linalg.",
        "The HW design is great in the sense that it strongly correlates with and even serves as a complement to the course material. However, I wish the difficulty levels (and corresponding time needed) across HWs will be consistent.\n\nAlso, now I have finished the midterm and final of this course. I wish our instructors should giving better exams, I felt some questions are too straightforward and not comprehensive enough to measure my performance holistically.",
        "Gonna throw this here because I don't see a specific spot that relates. The assignments and even the midterm/final (to a much lessor degree) were extraordinarily disconnected from the lecture material to the point where completing the assignments was a brutal time suck involving 3\u20134 office hour visits a week minimum. Issue was since every other student was having this problem, the office hours were massively over attended, and getting useful help was difficult. The homework was quite obviously based on previous years lecture content available online, and less to the in person lectures during the quarter, so attending the lectures in person actually hindered one's ability to complete the assignments unless you also watched the online lectures. Even then, the assignments were still quite disconnected. Essentially my recommendation is do not take this class if you haven't taken linear algebra and are not already quite familiar with Machine Learning mathematics. It is billed as an intro, but it is graded as if you are an expert.",
        "Assignments were often poorly made, with template code taken from a PDF that often didn't work. It was hard to understand the true scope of the class, especially when it didn't go into much depth during lectures. Overall, it seems like lecture could have been more aligned with the homeworks and/or homework adjusted to be more hands\u2013on. Feedback was also given with 2\u20133 weeks delay, with minimal comments from graders for improvement. The lack of positive feedback for the graduate project is also unacceptable, especially given that this class is supposed to be many people's first class in ML.",
        "It could be a little bit faster.",
        "This course has the perfect content and structure. It is, however, implemented very poorly. Anyone with access to just the recorded videos and some of the assignment questions would derive more value from the class than the ones attending all the lectures and recitation sessions. I hope the instructors recognize the value of what their course has to offer and invest some more effort into the course administration and better utilize the resources such as TAs at their disposal to offer a more engaging and enlightening course"

I'd particularly recommend reworking HW 5; the back half of question 2 and 3 were really unclear at times. This is an exception and not a rule; the PSETs were quite good otherwise.\n\u2013 I think CMSC 121 or 122 had a dedicated module on graphing in Python and I know for a fact 121 had an entire NumPy module. If possible, those would be great optional resources to students with less exposure to NumPy specifically, and would also make the graphing code more readable/intuitive.",

Lastly, the pacing of this course should be improved. Professor Willett's lectures were often repetitive (she spent half the time at the beginning of each lecture reviewing the previous lecture). I wish she had gone through things more quickly so we would have had time for more at the end. We got through like 2/3 of what was planned on the course syllabus.",

However, during the second half of the class when the course switched to Professor Jonas, these lecture notes and what was covered in Jonas's lectures often didn't match up as well as before, making the process of self\u2013studying after lecture harder to do in an organized way for the student. A lot of time was spent frantically scrolling through Willet's online lecture notes to find the material which Jonas was covering.",

        "I understand it is difficult to administer a course that is foundational and hence needs to touch on the breadth as well as some depth of the underlying math in ML. But I feel the course will benefit from a laser focus on what concepts the instructor's want the students to master. Just broadly introducing multiple topics and then providing a few additional resources for students interested to delve deeper does this course a disservice. We don't need this course to tell us that the world of math of ML is vast and that this course only scratches the surface. It'd be better if instead specific topics are covered in depth \u2013 especially once SVD is introduced",
        "The standards for the psets were different between the two instructors. In particular, Jonas expected us to write a lot more code from scratch and figure out documentation and such on our own \u2013 which is perfectly fine and I see the benefit in that. However, as a result, the first pset he assigned took way longer than it should have for most people simply because we all assumed everything we needed was in the pset doc."

This course had an army of TAs \u2013 and still the Ed discussions were only somewhat useful, and the recitation sessions were a big disappointment. I would rather suggest a flipped classroom model for the recitation session \u2013 since it would ensure that students solve specific problems and have the solutions for them \u2013 and in case they are unable to follow something in the solutions, they attend the TA session to clarify.

Numerical might make the first half of the course *very* redundant but the computing considerations covered might still be worthwhile. I think someone with 0 linear algebra background is going to struggle more. It's really not possible to crash course the topic in a few weeks, and you need to have internalized a good bit to really appreciate the beauty of the SVD and subsequent topics.",

Psets are very helpful (they're ungraded, so I ended up doing them all the weekend before the exams but they were super useful to clarify lecture content). Projects were alright, mostly math derivations so the actual code was like 3 lines for 1.5 pages of derivations. Prof is super kind and helpful in office hours.",
        "Lectures introduced the topics, and projects/p\u2013sets gave us the opportunity to work with the material & ensure we understood it",
        "In lectures, the professor introduced concepts. There were 4 mini\u2013projects, which applied various concepts from lectures. There were also optional problem sets, which further expanded on the concepts from lectures.",
        "The exam/project grading is a really great idea and I hope it stays. Homework being optional, but necessary to know if you want to do well on exams while emphasizing 4 applied projects is really creative and a great way to teach in my opinion. Those were a great way to apply the skills we learned.",

We mostly had to derive formulas from the lectures and implement them in python functions. I thought these were fairly simple and useful for demonstrating the concepts we learned in class. However, a few improvements can be made: (1) directions should be written with more clarity, and (2) the source code should be tested/updated before being assigned to ensure that it works. There were times where I spent hours trying to figure out what was wrong with my implementation only to realize that the source code used deprecated functions. Also, we were sometimes required to implement certain methods that relied on the dataset having specific dimensions or values, and these were not supplied.\n\nPSETs were optional and covered a broader range of topics with more mathematical rigor. They were (intentionally) more difficult than midterm and exam questions. I wish that these matched the difficulty level and structure (e.g. multiple choice questions) of the exams because it would've been good practice. I mostly reviewed lecture slides and the PSETs to study for exams, but never felt prepared enough to do well on them."

We don't really have the ability to apply what we learned, e.g., for the neural network project, we just wrote the propagation part (which is like 4 lines) and everything else is provided. This is good for giving us a sense of how neural network is but at the end of the day I still don't know how to write one on my own if I am asked to. Say if we can spend another week learning the code and application of it that would be much better",
        "There tends to be many notation errors in slides/during lectures, which make things confusing",
        "It wasn't structured well and the lectures were not very good.",
        "I appreciated the p\u2013sets being optional, since it allowed us to focus more times on the projects/studying for the exam. At the same time, I wish there were more opportunities for practice outside of the p\u2013sets, since I think that would've been very helpful for the exams",
        "I often found the lectures confusing, especially after the midterm. Furthermore, the lectures and projects sometimes use different notation for the same term, which was extremely confusing.",
        "It's in kind of a weird middle ground where it half expects you to know everything from Foundations of ML and half doesn't. I think it should commit to one or the other (ideally the former).",
        "For anyone with less statistics background, DONT TAKE THIS CLASS! The only prerequisite of this course is CS 253, but the second half of the course requires a huge amount of stats knowledge. As a non\u2013stats major student, I felt overwhelmed and failed to understand many concepts well.",
        "The instructions for the coding assignments were a little vague, but they would grade quite nicely to make up for it. Generally very interesting course!",
        "The projects were a bit nebulous in what they were looking for and almost every single one of them had a typo that made it really hard to get started with.\n\nHomeworks being optional was clearly a model that was previously requested, in the end I'm not convinced that was helpful \u2013\u2013 I definitely would have learned the material better if I didn't cram/skim homeworks before the exam.",

If lecture recordings can be provided that would be better as in the winter quarter it is harder to keep up with the class. Also if we can spend more time talking about HOW TO WRITE CODE for the concepts we've covered that will be tremendously helpful",
        "A bit more mathematical derivation on the slides would've been helpful, especially when it came to computing gradients.",
        "Cover fewer topics but with more clarity.",
        "Slow down during lecture, and define abbreviations more than once, and emphasize why we're using them (Took me like 3 weeks to figure out what MLE was after it was first introduced. Same with the discriminant function)",

        "Having a fixed zoom link on the canvas site would allow students to attend classes remotely due to illnesses without the added hassle of emails",
        "\u2013 Don't review so much from Foundations of ML; Kernel Methods and potentially PCA might warrant some time because they were passed by a little quickly in Foundations of ML, but regression is just not something we needed to spend any time on. That time could be re\u2013allocated to looking at convolutional neural nets or other very interesting topics that the course would benefit greatly from. The first 6 lectures can honestly be skipped in favor of a deeper dive into these more interesting topics later in the course. Commit to the fact that students understood the course content in Foundations of ML and move on.\n\n\u2013 The slides are fine but the annotations are quite hard to follow; consider incorporating an organized LaTeX writeup for many of the technical derivations in the slides and the course resources will go from okay to incredible. This weakness was especially apparent in the second half of the course when we got to probabilistic learning; I don't know how someone who isn't a STAT major could follow the last few sets of slides; I used outside resources when reviewing them. The slides have a really strong base, but many of the annotations just aren't useful for review; going back and organizing them meticulously, perhaps with links to relevant background info (e.g. priors and other bayesian topics) would drastically improve the materials.\n\n\u2013 Beef up the statistics prerequisites. Foundations AND STAT 244/245 should be a hard requirement (currently it's either/or), because this course is not a suitable first introduction to Bayesian stats, which is not covered in foundations. I was able to figure it out because of prior statistics electives, but a CS major without a dedicated introduction to statistics is going to struggle almost surely, even if they did do well in Foundations.\n\n\u2013 Ed was a little unresponsive, which caused a few inconveniences",
        "The instructor could provide more opportunities to demonstrate learning. While the lack of assignments outside of short bi\u2013weekly projects allowed me to spend minimal time on the class, it also meant that I was ill\u2013prepared for exams.",

I think it is better to have a whole course about the last three weeks' materials (three weeks are too short!). Also, it will be great to have recordings for us to review.",
        "he sometimes went a bit too fast with the math derivations, so slowing down would help",

So many contradictions in every part of the project and the projects were very insubstantial later on. 30% of the last project was adding four characters to prewritten code. But overall I learned a lot from everything and do think it is a good course with a really engaged professor.",

I have taken TTIC 31230: Fundamentals of Deep Learning, which gave me some exposure to the material.",

        "It's a tough course for someone with very little background in math. Do not take it with professor Rand if you are newer to math. he uses so many symbols and communicates as a mathematician instead of a human. take it with another professor if you can",
        "This is an excellent course for learning various topics in discrete math and improving your problem solving skills. The problem sets in particular were always very well\u2013designed and featured fun and interesting ways to approach topics. Professor Rand also posts detailed lecture notes on his website, which were incredibly helpful for reviewing the material.",
        "Professor Rand has a special knack for making simple concepts confusing.\n\nWhen he explained natural deduction, he did so so unclearly that I completely misunderstood what it was. It was only after the first PSet was graded that I realized this was not the case. Then, when I figured out how it worked through practice and the help of TAs, I was alarmed by how something so simple could have been so badly explained in the lecture.\n\nThere were some topics from this course that I already knew, such as induction and combinatorics. Maybe because I learned these topics before from other teachers and had someone to compare Professor Rand to, the confusing nature of his explanations was all the more apparent. I felt bad for my classmates who were learning about these topics for the first time from Professor Rand. Topics that Professor Rand took a whole lecture to explain, my previous teachers were able to explain much more clearly and in a shorter amount of time.\n\nI felt like there were two reasons he was confusing in lectures:\n1) He was explaining concepts that he was already very familiar with to a crowd that should be considered to be unfamiliar with them. In the first class, he noted that this was the \"curse of knowledge\" and that he would try to avoid this. Unfortunately, he did not avoid this well. In topics that I was previously familiar with, I would catch him making jumps that in my opinion should have been explained to new students.\n2) He made up examples to explain concepts on the spot. While doing these examples he would often find that they were not as simple as he expected (and probably not the most appropriate example to introduce students to a specific concept). I was surprised to learn from an upperclassman friend that Professor Rand has been teaching this class for years (and in a similar manner). At this point, I would have assumed that he would have figured out what examples he was going to use and how he was going to teach the class.",
        "I basically failed Introduction to Proofs, and I think this class did a lot better of a job presenting the material to someone who was new to proof\u2013based math. It is a loooooot easier than any math class though.",
        "Assignments/tests are graded very strictly and it is often hard to figure out what you did wrong.",
        "I found it really hard at times (especially the exams) but that's probably my bad. Aside from clarifying what some homework problems were asking I don't see how this course could improved, the content is just tricky",
        "Rand is an awful instructor, he makes lecture incredibly confusing and it is hard to follow his train of thought. Even asking clarifying questions on the EdStem, he is often extremely cryptic and unhelpful. His homework questions are also worded incredibly poorly and make many of the problems almost unanswerable without clarifying questions.",
        "Grading was pretty hard compared to the other section (not taught by Professor Rand). He's a great professor and a good teacher, but I wish he'd been a bit more generous with the curves. Some of the content like the logic at the beginning of the course also struck me as a bit pedantic and none of my other CS friends either at this school or otherwise had ever seen the system he used."

Sometimes we got bogged down in the minutiae of problems which distracted from the concepts we were trying to learn.",
        "I don't feel like I ever learned how to go about thinking how to solve proofs. I was mostly frantically searching my notes to find an example we did that somewhat mirrored the proof in question, not independently creating solutions. This really showed on the midterm, which I think most of the class struggled with heavily.",
        "The instructor could give more practice problems and make the midterm a lot easier \u2013 it destroyed everyone (the average was a 58%) and felt really pointless and not motivating after all the work everyone put in the first few weeks.",
        "Not much, this was an excellent course overall",
        "In addition to being a confusing lecturer, Professor Rand also had a knack for making questions ambiguous.\n\nAgain, this seemed like a \"curse of knowledge\" issue. It seemed like Professor Rand knew in his head what he expected students to do, but his questions were at times ambiguous. He of course knew how they should be interpreted, but for students who do not know what was going on in his head, they were only confusing. For first\u2013time learners, I believe this must have been quite the struggle.\n\nEven TAs during office hours sometimes would be confused about the expectations of questions. In those cases, they would always tell us to ask Professor Rand for clarification. Given that Professor Rand has taught this class multiple times before, I assumed he would have learned which questions were ambiguous and perhaps offered more information/clarification for those questions.",

        "one of the midterm question topic wasnt covered in the lectures",
        "Prof. Rand is a rather poor public speaker who says \"Um....\" countless times during class. Also he has a habit of responding with \"Sure\" when someone raises their hand which I thought was a little bit rude.",
        "I feel that requiring and assigning readings to go along with each topic that we learn will be helpful. I understand that there were specific chapters of recommended books given to us on each of the topics that we learned in the schedule, assigning and requiring specific readings would be more beneficial to everyone.",

So if you take this course you basically have to teach yourself by using the resources provided to you (including office hours) and be really self\u2013directed",
        "Sometimes I wish we received more practice material or had larger assignments. While that might seem counter intuitive, I think it would help build intuition on how to approach different kinds of problems. Because of the smaller amount of assigned material, I think it made exams harder.",

        "The TA Ryan was very helpful. However, he would try to solve the questions with us during office hours. For particularly challenging questions (which is what students often want help with), large chunks of OH time were taken up by Ryan trying to figure out what was going on alongside everyone while taking input from students. There was one OH in particular that I remember where many students were stuck on a question and Ryan was trying to solve this in OH. He was taking suggestions from students and seeing if they would work. By the end of the 1.5 hours, he was NOT able to solve the question (and therefore wasn't able to answer questions students might have had about other questions).\n\nIn my opinion, it would have been much more beneficial if he had solved the questions in advance and been able to nudge students in the right direction with hints when they were stuck. This way, he wouldn't take most of OH trying out different ideas from students (which most probably won't work otherwise why else would they be in OH) and instead help students much more efficiently.",

At the same time, people who have seen the concepts before are usually bored due to the lack of new content.

It's hard to keep track of the logical steps we've taken when it's only explained verbally which makes it hard to know what we're even confused about. Sometimes once he's done explaining he'd just click through the entire slide without showing all the written steps in entirety at all.\nAlso, putting in more effort to pinpoint what exactly we're confused about.

The assignments were nearly random in their difficulty, not just from week to week, but from problem to problem.

        "I really enjoyed this class and the material. However, I do have two major issues with this class:\n1. The psets are 60% of your grade. The result of this is that I spend a large amount of my time proofreading and editing my psets so that they're perfect because they are such a huge portion of the grade. This is really tedious and annoying, and a bit of a shame because the problems are so interesting. I really enjoy solving the problems, but I can't stand the tedious proofreading every week. If psets were, say, 10% of the grade, I would just write up my answers and turn them in, which would be a lot of fun.\n2. The midterm was extremely computational. There was only like one proof, and even that was just a straightforward induction. Given that this is an honors math course, I didn't like this; math is about proofs, not computation. And it was also open note, which I disagreed with.",
        "difficult but rewarding",
        "Discrete Math is a beautiful mathematical topic, and one of my favorites. That is why I find it genuinely impressive how sufficiently Professor Razbarov has killed it. He wildly misunderstands the experience and familiarity of his students with the content he seeks to teach. He skims or skips critical topics that are unfamiliar and that really would be helped by more depth, and spends far too much time on topics that are either only tangentially relevant to the course, or far outside its scope (often both). He is wildly unhelpful in providing assistance to students, his homeworks are completely unpredictable in their difficulty and on occasion have assumed knowledge not found in this class or any of its prerequisites. In order to ask for help in this class, three people must publicly ask for a hint on a specific question, to which he will provide a \"hint\" that is either an outright solution, or actively unhelpful \u2013 aside from this, he is very unwilling to help his students. In fact, in making the course competitive, setting up this hint policy, and not providing much assistance in general, he is actively discouraging collaboration.\nAs a final comment: you will not fail this class. His curve is rather generous, although it is competitive. But if you are interested in a first exposure to discrete math topics, or are curious about different creative ways to approach problems utilizing new techniques, this class is not that.",
        "Don't take this course if you just want to fulfill a requirement. Unless you are passionately interested in the topic, and you will know you are not if you just want to take an honors class since your pride doesn't let you take the regular one, the course is just a burden. If you ARE interested, however, amazing course!",

We covered graph theory in extensive, excruciating detail, to an extent that should in my opinion be saved for a course dedicated to the topic. On the other hand, some topics, such as counting and probability, went sorely underexplored, which is a disservice to both the class and the students within. There is no reason we should have spent significantly more time on graph theory than on either counting or probability, especially when the time we did spend on counting and probability was very poorly spent \u2013 we touched on a single example of a random variable, very few explorations of different probability distributions, and almost no exploration of how these topics can be approached, explored, and utilized to greater mathematical understanding.",

The homeworks were extensions of the lectures, usually problems involved designing an algorithm similar to or based off one we learned in class. The problems were challenging, especially post\u2013midterm, but I think they helped me learn via applying the lecture material.",
        "haifeng was a great lecturer! i loved his energy and honestly only came to class because he was so enthusiastic",
        "Lectures were moderately helpful but the best resources were the writeups that Professors Xu and Drucker uploaded to Canvas/Ed outside of classes, as well as the notes written by Professor Ng for past versions of this course. Unfortunately assignments were not particularly helpful because most of them were not graded in time, or returned with detailed enough feedback.",
        "lectures were the main thing. discussion sections were just office hour sessions that TAs/instructors hosted to help with homework",
        "Lectures were incredibly helpful for understanding the material, as well as the posted lecture notes. Assignments were very time consuming, but provided good practice for the material. Working through the corresponding textbook readings definitely helped with success on the assignments.",

        "valuable course to learn algorithms",
        "The grading standards for homeworks are confusing, you need to ask questions on Ed to clarify, and grades are delayed toooo much. I still don't have my third homework graded.",
        "This is more of an overall organizing issue across all 3 sections of the course rather than Haifeng's responsibility \u2013\u2013 homework is not graded in time and at the end of the quarter we still only have 2 homework grades returned; answer keys to the homework problems are not released so it is impossible to really learn and improve (and there is simply no time at all in office hours for anyone to ask about a previous homework); there is not enough office hour / Q&A time to sufficiently address students' questions. At the end of the quarter, I feel that I still only have the same amount of skills as I had before taking this course, unlike other courses I have taken in other schools where I could see my skill growth every day.",
        "Let me preface this by saying that I liked Haifeng as an instructor. However, for the overall class (combined with Drucker's section), the grading inconsistency across graders and submissions really discouraged and inhibited my intellectual curiosity. Furthermore, when I brought up this issue, it was not addressed but brushed aside by the person reviewing the requests. I felt discouraged and disrespected in this environment and it was not at all conducive to my learning. The rubric also was extremely unfair and did not reflect my actual knowledge of the topics; instead, it seemed to penalize students simply for the sake of it \u2014 without any consideration for the actual effort we put in. I would not recommend this class if you are simply looking to learn about algorithms. If you are a cs major, good luck.",
        "The grading was super inconsistent and we received little to no feedback on grades during the quarter",
        "Overall this course taught me algorithms, but the expectation of homework is so unclear. Not once was it conveyed to students. Furthermore, this course favored all the math majors who know how to structure proofs. This is more an English class and a math class than cs class. I wish I was good at writing these proofs because I understand all the concepts clearly but proving them(WHICH WAS NOT TAUGHT IN CLASS), was a different story",
        "Possibly one of the worst\u2013run courses I've taken here \u2013 no/lagged PSET solutions, no lecture notes, lagged grading, innaccurate grading \u2013 many points gotten back off of regrades, long assignments, take\u2013home test with inflated curve because everyone is most likely cheating",
        "This is an extremely challenging course, however you learn a lot from it.",
        "The psets took a lot of time and grading was very slow.",
        "Homework isn't handed back in time to adjust for grading standards or to understand what you need to improve upon, and various standards and deadlines are constantly changing, making it hard to adequately budget time for the class.",
        "Problem sets were not returned in a timely manner. The last three were still ungraded by the time of the final exam. Also this class was supposed to have discussion sections but they were replaced with regular office hours. These sections made it harder for me to register for the course, so I would have much preferred if they decided to get rid of them before registration.",
        "haifeng is an incredible professor. it was his first year, but he was very comfortable teaching the content and explaining questions to us. drucker is a terrible professor. he is very disorganized and put us all in a terrible spot in terms of getting grades back to understand what we were doing wrong.",
        "this is one of those CS classes that two professors handle jointly (in our case, profs. xu and drucker). I personally preferred prof. xu as a lecturer, but they're both excellent professors (and people) and the class content is great. it's difficult for someone who hasn't been exposed to the topics before, but well worth the work. there's no busy work\u2013\u2013everything has its purpose\n\nbut WOW the grading was slow. the professors apologized for this, but it feels like an administrative issue with the CS department. this class needs more graders \u2013\u2013 just by virtue of the structure (we're writing long, long proofs for every question on every homework, proving correctness, efficiency, etc.) of the content. in order to have any meaningful progress from midterm \u2013> final, this needs to be quicker.",
        "The course gets increasingly difficult and more time consuming as the quarter progresses. It is definitely important to go to lecture, as the assignments are directly related to the lecture material.",
        "Homework was never graded on time, so if you make a mistake on HW, you will never realize it and will make the same mistake again in your midterm and finals. It is ridiculous how the homework submitted a month (5 weeks ago) is still not graded, and we only received half of the hws graded by the finals day.",
        "We only got the 3 graded homeworks back before the final exam, of which none of the topics were tested on the final so the feedback was not useful. Additionally, there were not sample solutions provided until very late in the course so we had very few resources to try and improve.",
        "This course teaches students very important and practical topics in computer science, and I loved Haifeng\u2019s teaching, but the homeworks are just extremely long (even though it\u2019s 3/4 questions, each question\u2019s writeup takes at least 1000 words). I wished proofs weren\u2019t taken so rigorously and we had time to explore more algorithms instead of spending so much time writing up answers to a few of them.",
        "Homework was graded at a slow pace. We had two of them ungraded and one just released by the time of the final exam. This is definitely an interesting but challenging course.",
        "Generally in math classes the instructor proves the really complicated theorems in lectures and we are made to prove easier theorems in PSets.\n\nHere it is sort of the opposite where the lectures only cover the most basic problems and PSets are MUCH harder.",
        "This particular course offering had a big delay in grading homework, such that we only saw the first two (of three assigned) homeworks graded before the midterm, and the midterm was not graded until days before the final. Homeworks 3 and 4 were not graded until just before and *during* the take\u2013home final exam period, and homeworks 5 and 6 were not graded before the final exam at all. I hope that this is isolated to this offering and improves in the future, but be prepared to ask for help and extra clarification on your approaches as you go into the exams if feedback is not returned in a timely manner."

For the context, the homeworks were never graded on time and always took 5+ weeks to be graded. This TA was bold enough to post an Ed post blaming the reason for the HWs being graded late is because students write long proofs in hopes to fully deliver what they think that takes him 5 weeks to read all the proofs, and that for our future classes, students who don't know what to do should just give up and not try and just not submit anything so that it can make the graders' lives easier.

The OH held by staff may not be very helpful (sometimes also misleading), but the questions other students ask plus the hints provided on Ed often gave some clues. Also the writeup examples and proofs done in class are good templates to follow for getting full points in the HW.

But regardless of experience level, this course takes a very, very large amount of work in order to learn the material and complete, let alone do well on the homework assignments. If possible, I recommend taking this class only with two others. I took four total classes this quarter, including this one, and the workload for this course made it very, very difficult.

An example; an exam question said \"If no such pair does not exist, output \u201cDNE\u201d.\" I showed up to the first discussion section and was sitting there for an hour waiting for the TA to show up with many of my peers, and was only given a clarification much later that there were, in fact, no discussion sections. Communication was poor, with announcements at varying points being made on Canvas and on Ed. Graders were extremely harsh and penalizing for subjective to no reasons, and often not giving a clear explanation for it. An example; I got 10 points off a 35 point question because my answer was CORRECT, but I didn't have enough explanation. They are pedantic, subjective, and unduly harsh, and homeworks weren't returned in a timely manner. Regrade requests were met with hostile responses, and little to no explanation beyond broadly general statements and no examples of how an algorithm was wrong or needed expansion. This class has not set me up for success with tech interviews or a foundation in algorithms."

        "Algos blows. If you are a cs major this sucks but have fun I guess",
        "While the professors are excellent, I have no idea what the graders were doing. Not only were a majority of the homeworks not returned to us by the final, but our midterm was returned the week before.\n\nEvery grading I have received in this class has been riddled with errors that required regrade requests. My grader even forgot to grade the last two pages of my midterm, initially costing me 22% of the grade until submitting a regrade request. For a class as difficult as this, this is unacceptable.\n\nStudents need proper feedback on their work in order to properly understand how to properly write proofs on the subject they're being tested on. As of today (Sunday before final's week), I have not received any feedback on any of the homeworks with the topics on the final exam. How will I know if the approach I've been using earlier will net me a grade that will lead to me doing well in this course? I have no idea, because of the abysmal jobs the graders have been doing this entire quarter. I understand that there are a lot of students in the course, but there were as many taking discrete math, and we always got our homeworks back in a relatively timely manner. (We got all of them back by the final, at least!)\n\nNot to mention, we had undergraduate TA's for this class? Where were they! We had no office hours with them and I honestly have no idea what they were doing. The one graduate TA who's office hours I went to consisted of him clearly having conducted no preparation for the OH. This one time, he was complaining about UChicago to another undergrad for 30 minutes while I was waiting for him to answer my question. I understand that this university sucks, but I don't care, I go to office hours so it sucks less!\n\nbarring the grading / TA issues, the profs are excellent and the material is super cool. Hopefully CS dep't can take this feedback in stride and this class can be properly known as a rigorous but rewarding experience.",
        "This class was a BIG challenge. The lectures felt too theoretical for the homework\u2013 i often didn't feel like i was making real progress on the psets until I went to office hour and got hints. It was nice to be able to collaborate with others on homework for this reason. The grading in this class was SO SLOW. I understand that there was a shortage of TAs, but. Up until week 9, we only had the first two psets graded. we didn't get the third graded before the midterm, and only select answers were given for us to review. By week 9, we finally got the midterm graded (which was taken weeks earlier). We had to wait even further to get pset 3 graded\u2013 i just received it as of today, the monday of finals week. our final is in a couple of days and the tas already said they will be unable to get us our last two psets with feedback, and the third will likely be delivered a day before the final, if at all. feedback on the psets was sometimes too vague to be helpful, and sometimes it felt like an exorbitant amount of points were taken off for certain faults. this made for an overall very frustrating and exhausting experience in this class. how can we be expected to improve based on our mistakes if 1) we don't know what we messed up on and 2) if no one is responsive enough to answer our questions? thankfully answer keys were provided for some of the psets for the final. but at this point, i am just very exhausted and frustrated.",
        "Homeworks were graded very very slowly.",
        "The class itself was good, and I think lectures were relevant and the concepts were actually very interesting. However the sheer amount and complexity of material covered in 9 weeks makes this class extremely challenging, and the level of rigor required on proofs makes this class difficult if you don't have a strong theory background. That is all simply the nature of the class, however I take great issue with the overall organization of the course. We had homework due every week, but it took over a month to receive a grade and feedback on the homework assignments. When we did receive feedback, it was usually extremely harsh markdowns paired with one sentence of vague, copy/paste feedback. Some of the TA's also were completely unprepared/lacked the knowledge to help answer questions about the problem sets. This combination of things made it almost impossible to correct your mistakes to do better on the next homework/exams. We also constantly received conflicting information about how to structure our answers (ex: being told to write everything out and then being told that writing too much means your proof isn't rigorous and is probably wrong) which made it difficult to know what you were supposed to do. The professors were very understanding and accommodating to this, and I recognize much of this is beyond their control, but this was a beyond frustrating situation to be placed in for a course I'm required to take."

You can cut corners because you're the professor, but many of us are new and how are we supposed to learn if we've never seen something proven a certain way? Hand wavy explanations aren't sufficient. Write ups were extremely dense and hard to understand without an unduly long amount of effort. Homeworks were returned extremely late, giving us little time to ask for regrade requests and fairness in grading, and to explain our reasoning in the face of hostile and ambivalent graders who don't acknowledge any errors in their thinking or provide sufficient analysis and reasoning to understand what is wrong with our responses when downgraded. Furthermore, Prof. Drucker joined our student space on Discord\u2013\u2013I understand wanting to monitor for cheating, however responding to students complaining to their peers about this class is completely inappropriate.

I took all of Calc and Discrete (for math background).\n\nI will say, a lot of the difficulty of the course stems less from conceptual understanding and more from the difficult grading standards / inconsistent grading. Feels like it's more important to write a good looking proof than to be right, honestly. But I guess that is just what proof\u2013based classes are like.",

This class was mainly difficult because of the lack of feedback we received, as even by the time we took our final exam, only 3 homework out of 6 had been graded. Moreover, the grading was quite harsh and I did not think we were given clear expectations to succeed.",

I'm sympathetic to prospective SWEs/wtv that do not find these components useful (e.g. not even the text nor most classes in other schools seem to take as rigorous as an approach as we do), but I feel like the reasoning process is still useful indirectly.",

        "lectures were really helpful especially when supplemented by the textbook; orecchia is a great lecturer though it is definitely useful to go in with a vague idea of what he plans on talking about via textbook. the discussions were very helpful for cementing the content we talked about the week prior, and the assignments really forced me to understand exactly how these algorithms worked",
        "TAs absolutely made the course. Jonathan is easily the best TA i've ever had. His research is literally structured around education + CS, so he is sooooo good at explaining concepts and making sure that all of our assignments are actually contributing to learning. There were an insane amount of office hours available to go to and plenty of review sections etc. Discussions were also pretty helpful, but I think they would've been more helpful if discussions were lagged a week behind (our discussion topics covered material we just learned, so if you were behind or just didn't quite fully understand the material, it was a bit tough to take advantage fully of the discussion sections)",
        "The discussion sections were I think some of the most helpful\u2014they allowed me to clear up confusion from earlier lectures",
        "Lectures often felt quite rambly, and he made a lot of notes in a short period of time while covering the board with his body so it was often hard to see what he was writing until he moved to try and explain what he wrote down. Discussion sessions were nice to understand what happened.",

You are given three weeks to complete homework and resubmissions are allowed. Unfortunately, feedback (at least in my case) wasn't always helpful, which made it confusing as to what you should fix for the resubmission. On some occasions, after resubmitting, you will get feedback on something else that was wrong in the original submission, and you are left wondering why that wasn't part of the original feedback. Sometimes, even if you submit your homework early, it takes so long to get the initial feedback that you barely have time to resubmit. On the midterm, the median was very low, but it will not be curved. Instead, it seems that different components will be weighed differently for each student.\n\nDespite all this, I am thankful that the TAs did what they could to make this class more bearable. Ed was very helpful with answering questions.",

This is probably the hardest class I have taken (I'm in my 2nd year spring), and it might end up being one of the hardest classes (work\u2013wise and just by the fact that it hurts your brain). For the tests, it kinda sucks, but if you have a naturally lower IQ, no amount of extra studying is going to help much. I studied 4x more for the final (the most I've studied for any singular test), and still think I will probably do average at best hahaaa.. that's okay though I learned so much from this class...",

        "Notes not being available in any form online is pretty rough, especially because the textbook isn't fantastic so missing class feels fairly hard to recover from.",
        "Certain assignments took significantly longer to be graded and returned to us than expected. This delay in feedback caused mistakes from previous assignments to reappear and be marked down in future assignments. Feedback was also not very substantial as many points were taken off in a fairly arbitrary manner or for unclear reasons. Certain problems in assignments were also much higher in difficulty than classwork; this discrepancy left me and other students feeling unprepared to handle problems presented to us.",
        "Grading was a bit late and lectures could have been a little clearer.",
        "Grading on assignments is unbelievably slow. By the midterm, only 2/3 of the homeworks were graded. By the final, the midterm had only just been graded and NONE of the homeworks relevant for the final were graded!!! Moreover, the grading often made no sense and points were lost arbitrarily",
        "the homework problems in the latter half of the course were very difficult, such as the Billy (divide and conquer) and Pokemon (dynamic programming) problems. They were virtually impossible to solve without getting help at office hours. While I appreciate the interesting nature of the problems, I would have appreciated it more if we had simpler problems on these topics to help us get familiarized with the material",
        "Alright, this is a required course for CS majors so you have to take it so I'll try and let you know what you're getting yourself into. The class itself is actually interesting, but be prepared to spend some time on the write\u2013ups \u2013 the psets are pretty involved.\n\nFor our class, I've actually convinced the graders didn't know math. This will depend year on year but these people were actually awful. At times they just wouldn't read the arguments of your write\u2013up and try and just dock you like 20% of your grade despite you doing it right. Be prepared to send out those regrade requests. Also, these graders just couldn't get their work done. We barely got half of our psets back before the final \u2013 2 are going to be returned after it. Would have been nice to know what we did right / wrong.\n\nThe professors were pretty good / understanding, though.",
        "Terrible turnaround on homework. Our final was solely on topics that we received no feedback on. This is disrespectful and quite frankly a waste of the money we pay for this school, given that most students I know spent 15\u201320+ hours on each homework.",
        "Probably only useful for CS or CS\u2013adjacent students who want to gain practical knowledge in algorithmic problem solving. I wouldn\u2019t say that it is super interesting but definitely useful and I feel more competent at coding now",
        "This class is definitely not a trivial amount of work. Also, I don't think the course is balanced throughout the quarter. The first part of the quarter is easier and the second half gets significantly harder.",
        "The first five weeks were awesome. During the second half of the course, the pace of the class was a lot faster in order to finish all the content on time. I feel like the content after midterm was way harder, maybe we should spend less time in greedy and more time in DP and NP\u2013completeness. However, I think the Professor did a great job overall. The nine week quarter is the problem....",
        "Prof. Drucker is an incredibly supportive individual who makes it clear that he cares for his students and respects their health. At the same time, there were so many flaws with how this class was handled, but I believe many of those were out of his hands. The most egregious of these were the lack of quality help from TA's and the fact that we did not receive feedback on homework for weeks at a time, so for the majority of the class I had no idea what I was doing and how to fix my work.\n\nIf there is one thing this class needs, its actual discussion sections. We had discussion sections on the my.uchicago listing, but these were just OH. I had no idea initially how to write proofs that were sufficient for this class' standards. This resulted in significant points off in HW1 and 2. Prof. Drucker posted an example write\u2013up, and while this was helpful, it was not enough to clarify everything that we needed to do. Having discussion sections allows us to practice these proofs and get a better understanding of the material. Discussion Sections really helped me in Discrete Math and they would do well here too.",
        "The graders were astonishingly bad for this class, we had 3 homework assignments graded by the final exam (homework 4 was released halfway through it) and I had to submit multiple regrade requests to get the correct amount of points back. Not only was the homework graded in an untimely manner, it was graded poorly and many of the comments felt as if the graders had read half of the problem and just extrapolated the remaining answer. I genuinely think that two identical homework assignment could have a 15% difference between their two grades."

TA's also didn't show up to office hours regularly. I also wish our assignments were returned in a timely manner. I only have feedback on 2/6 psets and it opens everyone up to the problem of \"what if my proof method is fundamentally wrong and I carried it through psets 3\u20136?\" The expectations for our assignments were also not entirely clear because sometimes we were expected to prove very obvious side points and sometimes we were not.",
        "Follow a lesson plan.",

        "The lectures were not super well organized a lot of the time and following the line of thought and the proofs could be pretty challenging. I wish that Professor Drucker took more time in class to let students ask questions. Either he would not ask if anyone had questions or he would ask but then move on before we got a chance to ask. Also, the grading took a long time so we didn't receive any feedback past homework two until right before the final. This made it really hard to gauge how we were doin in the class.",
        "Professor Drucker really tried to explain all things clearly during the first half of the quarter, but I thought we spent a bit too much time on greedy, which is a relatively easy topic. Maybe reallocate more time to the more challenging topics will improve the quality of the course. Overall, Professor Drucker is a very good instructor.",

He was rude, unhelpful, and one of the worst teachers I have met within the CS major. He also refused to explain a concept to me, instead telling me to look on the notes for the class even after I told him I did not understand the notes. His grading standards also did not make any sense and did not seem to follow the rubric as other people with a different grader were not graded as harshly for certain questions. Additionally, he was also belittling many people during his office hours that came to him asking for help on solutions, telling them that their solution was just wrong and saying that he couldn't say why. He should get some kind of training on how to interact with students if he aims to interact with them in the future, or he should not be a TA.",

I do not feel this class prepares its students enough on its own to tackle the level of rigor and difficulty required to complete assignments.",

This felt like a similar experience to discrete math because I 1) just shakily learned how to write a proof in a very sped up 9 week quarter 2) am not interested in the topic. It will definitely be harder if you just learned how to write proofs like me and are still unsure about the expectations for them.",

        "Nominally, this course covered a selection of topics in combinatorics: heavy emphasis on hypergraphs/set systems and linear algebra methods, covered finite projective planes, affine geometries, finite fields, extremal set theory, set systems with restricted intersections, discrete probability, the probabilistic method, incidence matrices, and no doubt a dozen other things I'm forgetting.\n\nIn practice, this course is the masterwork of a narrative genius, expertly espousing a deep love of math and truly imbuing that in his students. I am a second\u2013year taking Honors Analysis, and this is the first true Math course I have taken. This class taught what it is to be a mathematician: the beauty and endurance and surprise of solving genuinely difficult problems.

        "Lectures were the best I have had here.",
        "Laszlo Babai is a fantastic lecturer and class time really helped understand concepts. However, most of the learning still comes from the psets, which are a LOT of work, even if you are doing the ordinary questions only. Expect to spend upwards of 25 hours per week on this class.",
        "The problem sets and bonus problems are the course.",
        "Lectures were very good, problem session was very helpful, but overall the most important thing in the class was homework. There were a lot of problems to complete every week, but for good reason. Combinatorics is all about problem solving.",
        "Lectures were the best part of this course, they were extremely informative and engaging.",
        "Lectures and assignments were extremely useful and challenged me a lot intellectually.",
        "The constant engagement and regular homework helped me to keep up with the fast\u2013paced nature of the course.",
        "Professor Babai's lectures are works of narrative genius. He describes concepts clearly and his lectures are well\u2013organized, of course, but the real beauty is the connections he draws between topics. Over the course of each of the 90\u2013minute class periods, he invariably gave proofs that made me indescribably excited. It is as though all the literary giants of history had come together with history's greatest mathematicians to bring the transcendent beauty of mathematics down to earth and show its secrets.\n\nAssignments in this course were difficult and long, and I loved them. Professor Babai gives no tests; they do not represent mathematics. There is a commensurate increase in workload, but each of his problem sets taught me more than a full week of lectures in another class would. I struggle to convey the beauty of the problems he assigns: the best I can do is to say that each week had no fewer than half\u2013a\u2013dozen \"a\u2013ha!\" moments that instill a real confidence in one's mathematical abilities. No matter how well you did, you leave this class knowing you solved hard problems and learned a lot of math. He has a few classifications of problems (Ordinary, Bonus, Challenge) and there is no expectation you can complete all of them. These classifications also help in Professor Babai's goal of making the class accessible to a those with a variety of mathematical backgrounds (for instance, the class is cross\u2013listed as an undergraduate and graduate class.\n\nFinally, Problem Sessions were excellent: in them, Professor Babai mostly presented elegant solutions to past weeks' problems, giving resolution to problems you weren't able to solve and contributing to the abundance of mathematical beauty in the class.",
        "Lectures were fantastic (except for the last few weeks). Problem sets contributed most to learning, and were very long.",

        "Honestly this was by far the best course I have ever taken. Babai is an excellent lecturer. He manages to cover a lot ever lecture but I never felt like he was ever going too fast (and occasionally felt the class was slightly too slow in the beginning), and this was because he explained everything very clearly and was a very engaging lecturer. He really knows what he is doing!",

      "Thinking about your time in the class, what aspect of the instructor's teaching contributed most to your learning?": [
        "The lectures were fantastic! Babai explains thing very very clearly and showed us many astonishing theorems and problems despite the fact that most of us had essentially no knowledge on these topics coming in. I also really enjoyed the use of chat questions during class to get everyone engaged. The connections between all the different things we learned was also wild!",
        "The way babai breaks concepts down and takes questions meant that even as somebody with a relatively limited background in mathematics, I was able to understand most of what was happening.",

Ultimately, having to use an electronic tool in class was a source of distraction for me\u2013 I find it far easier to focus if I'm disconnected from the internet.",
        "Less ordinary problems. Some felt like DO problems and I did not learn much from them but typing them all up added a lot of stress to my workload. Maybe a couple more bonus problems in their place\u2014those were fun and I always learned something from them!! This wasn't a thing that affected my learning but some problems were a little misevaluated imo, for example some 12 point bonuses took me far longer to solve than some 15\u201316 point ones. But maybe this is personal.",

The HW problems, especially the bonus ones, are absolutely beautiful, but they take time\u2013usually 1\u20133 problems per pset will take 3\u20137+ hours. The total time commitment for me was about 30\u201335 hours per week for the psets (I solved pretty much all ordinary problems and most bonus problems but usually missed 1\u20133 bonuses per pset due to diffculty/time cosntraints) alone, but it was worth it! Also make sure to brush up on linear algebra before or at least during the course as it came up very often and way more than I expected.",
        "This course is easily the most challenging course I have taken at UChicago. This is a challenging course no matter your background, but my limited experience in proof based mathematics did me no favors. However, the organization of this course (no exams, ORD problems vs BON problems) means that I was able to still take this course and do somewhat decently in it. This is a testament to Babai, who has been able to design a course that challenges individuals appropriately no matter their background. The course always felt very hard, but not completely impossible, which is kind of the best thing about it.",

But Professor Babai endeavors to make it accessible to a variety of backgrounds, and it seems to me he has succeeded. That said, I have a relatively\u2013strong background in math (though I am not a graduate student), so it may be that others felt overwhelmed.",

He is precise and rarely makes mistakes, and, when he does, he is always thankful when someone points it out.

        "Unless you already know you want to specialize in graph theory and are mentally prepared for working 15~20 hours and still possibly get a B, DON'T take this course with the intention to learn knowledge. Just audit it. Taking it only takes too much time and leaves a dent on the GPA.",
        "Difficult, but I learned a lot.\nIt's definitely very worthwhile, but you have to allocate your course load appropriately to make the most out of it.",
        "It is SO SO SO hard. SO much work, but SO rewarding at the end of it. My grade in this class is nothing special, yet I honestly don't mind because I've learned more here than in any other class. And I'm not one to typically say something like this, this class was just special.",
        "This course is great, but challenging. If you are a math/CS major trying to gain IQ points, take this class (this and Honors Combinatorics are easily my favourite classes i've taken at the school).",
        "Homeworks were way too hard imo.",
        "Prof. Laszlo Babai is amazing \u2013\u2013 if you get the chance to take this class, do it!",
        "This is one of the best math courses I have ever taken in my time at this university.",
        "great course",
        "This was the hardest course I've taken as a Math and CS major. You learn an obscene amount of graph theory, but this is at the cost of constant Psets that are extremely long and the refusal of any help. You aren't allowed to ask any questions about the current pset during office hours or at all because that would \"take the gift of discovery from you,\" which means if you are stuck then congrats, you are getting that question wrong. The standards for grades are also unclear as well. At the beginning it is said that to get an A or A\u2013 you need to do some of the bonus problems. This, however, translates to doing about 40% of all the bonus problems and every single regular problem to be told that you are still getting a B+.",
        "The learning comes mainly from the PSETS, and this is because the PSETS are very involved. Most problems are released usually Wed/Thurs and are due Monday so expectation is to spend most of the weekend on the PSETS"

      "Thinking about your time in the class, what aspect of the instructor's teaching contributed most to your learning?": [
        "The HW. That's where the learning happens",
        "preparation; storytelling; effective use of technology",
        "1. Prof. Babai is very committed, holding discussion sessions himself and grading problems himself.\n2. Prof. Babai really knows frontier graph theory and is able to occasionally touch on those topics.\n3. Another likable aspect is that all problems alongside reviews of related concepts can all be found on a single monolithic webpage which you can just bookmark, making access and lookup easy.",
        "Discussion section was fantastic and Prof. Babai was happy to go for 2+ hours every Friday covering problems.",
        "Professor Babai was an amazing lecturer and very clear in conveying ideas. He goes at a very rapid speed, but is always willing to slow down to make clarifications and address any misconceptions. He has great blackboard organization and always strives to make a connection with his audience so that they follow along at each step. His math lectures are a masterclass in pedagogy: he strikes a fine balance between intuition and proper formalisms/mathematical notation, while showcasing the inherent beauty of the subject. The course was very well planned: Prof. Babai always sought to maintain a coherent narrative and we brought in concepts from different areas of math in a fascinating way.",
        "The lectures were amazing as I said earlier. The problem sessions were also useful, and I thought professor Babai was really available and willing to teawch outside of class as well.",
        "He's nice and surprisingly funny during lectures, but most of all doesn't have the air of arrogance that other professors of his stature tend to have. Rather, he actively encourages students to interrupt him during lectures with questions and interrogate him on his blackboard work, and revels in this back\u2013and\u2013forth process. Even if I wasn't participating in class as much as other students, it was still a super cool atmosphere that makes you pumped to learn.\n\nIn addition, although this is obviously a course on graph theory itself, Babai is incredibly knowledgeable on the history of the field (seeing as how he was a close collaborator with Erdos and the student of Turn and Sos \u2013\u2013 three absolute titans in the world of graph theory and combinatorics), and was able to provide insights into who proved what notable results, how certain results were derived from other known results, and the parts certain people played in writing the book on this wonderful field. This, in combination with his fantastic lectures on the material itself, truly helped solidify for me an understand of the field in its entirety rather than just the math.",
        "Prof. Babai is clearly very excited about the material.",
        "Problem Sessions on Fridays were quite helpful in reviewing tough problems from previous PSETs. The prof. provides extremely elegant proofs in this sessions and provides helpful feedback for students.",
        "The problem sets helped me clarify my understanding of the concepts involved through practice and variation on themes.",

        "Being more prepared with the homework assignments \u2013 I understand that they are to follow after the class, but it sometimes felt like homework was posted very last minute or with clear mistakes that (though they were fixed) forced me to delay starting problems."

        "Not really hard, but infinitely tricky. That is, more like High School Olympiad than like proper advanced graduate math.",
        "The most difficult class I've taken here so far as a third year math major. Homework is fair but there is a lot of it and the difficulty gap between the easiest and hardest HW problems is massive. I took a lighter (3 class) courseload in anticipation for spending a ton of time on this course.",
        "Very difficult (15\u201325 HW problems a week, the bonus problems which were all required for A\u2013 or A grades were often very challenging). I came in with only regular analysis (203\u2013204) and linear algebra (20250) and very little prior exposure to discrete math. The first few homeworks felt especially overwhelming, but I adjusted to the pace over time. My advice would be to revise linear algebra (esp. spectral theory) and read up on basic discrete probability so that you won't have to juggle the course content as well as this prerequisite knowledge at the same time. Don't let this deter you: it was still an extremely worthwhile experience overall! I learned a ton from this quarter, but make sure that you plan accordingly so that your other courses leave sufficient time for the high homework load.",
        "I've done quite a bit of proof\u2013based math before this as a math major.",
        "Very difficulty, very worth it. If you put in the time (and you have some experience with proofs), you will do well.",
        "As a fourth\u2013year math major who's going to get a PhD in computer science right after undergrad, it was more difficult than it should have been. These homeworks were quite hard, and he assigns half of each week's homework as \"bonus\", which are harder on average, but then makes it so that you can only get an A or A\u2013 by doing a lot of these problems, which defeats the whole point of calling it \"bonus\". I'm a busy person and did not have time to spend hours upon hours grinding these problem sets, and so I found it hard to scrape by with a decent grade, which I think is unfair since I definitely put in a lot of effort and also understood the lectures very well.",
        "This is quite a difficult course, but is also a gem.",
        "Very difficult if you aim to do every problem and the challenge problems. I got mileage out of my existing combinatorial background, but this class requires a lot of time and effort regardless.",
        "I think if i had taken a course on probability i would have been slightly better prepared, but I had access to all the resources I needed and was able to pick it up straightaway.",
        "very difficult",
        "I am a math and cs major who has pretty much finished both majors. Regardless, this was easily the hardest course I have ever taken. The concepts themselves aren't too difficult if you have a very deep understanding of analysis, discrete, and lin alg, but the amount of work is extremely hard to keep up with. The only assignments are psets, but every pset is extremely long. This is combined with not being able to get any help in office hours or over email so if you don't understand how to approach a problem then you are unfortunately stuck and can't get help.",
        "With analysis, the course was very approachable (no step learning curve), but it was very difficult nonetheless",
        "He gives a lot of homework and it is very difficult. Be prepared to struggle \u2013\u2013 but once I was finished I found myself to be much better prepared in general for math not just for what the class covered (which is, admittedly, a lot)."

        "One thing that was a bit frustrating in lectures was the deep focus on constructions rather than any applications. It would help to maybe spend more time giving some examples on objects we have discussed and less time constructing things.",
        "Not much I can think of.",
        "I can tell that Professor Morrisey puts in an effort to teach us (e.g. he's willing to push back pset deadlines when the class seemed confused, he pauses during lecture to ask if anyone has questions), so I really appreciate him for that because he's at least one of the professors who cares about students' learning, and I have faith he'll become a good professor with more experience.\n\nMy main constructive criticism is the lectures: the lectures were sometimes unclear and confusing, probably because logic is such a notation heavy course and the professor sometimes messes up notation on the board or not define what type of object something is before using it in a proof, and the small mistakes would just add up for me. He would also sometimes not explain certain things and I would assume something was one way only to realize that it was another way later. Usually when this happens in a course, I'm okay because we would be following a textbook, and I would just learn from the textbook instead of the professor's lectures. However, for this class, we don't follow any textbooks (Professor Morrisey does publish his lecture notes but I unfortunately don't find them any clearer than his lectures, especially because the details in many proofs were skipped, unlike how things are in textbooks), so I don't have that as a resource. And I know I wasn't the only one who found the lectures confusing, because I talked to other students in the class and it seemed like most people were pretty lost.\n\nProfessor Morrisey does mitigate the situation by pausing during lectures and asking if we have any questions, but towards the end of the course, I was so lost that I don't even know what questions to ask to improve my understanding. I think Professor Morrisey is really smart, and he understands the material very well himself, so it's easy to forget details when explaining things, which makes things confusing for students who have never seen any of this before.\n\nTo be fair, part of my struggles was also because I was taking a couple other math classes at the same time, so in the last two week, because this class got so confusing and it's less important to me than my other classes, I prioritized studying for my other classes over this class. I know that if I was willing to spend 20+hrs a week on this class, I would be able to master the material by self\u2013studying. But I guess I just think if the lectures were better or if we were following a good textbook, then my life would be much easier.",

The questions were pretty good, a few took a while but were mostly worth it.\n\nTests \u2013 do what tests do. Actually, studying for them was probably good for my learning. The questions were fair, 1 was actually really cool.",

        "Lectures were good for getting an intuitive understanding, but the textbook was better for getting rigorous definitions and explanations. The textbook is definitely important in this class. Assignments were great for solidifying the content \u2013 problems were chosen very well overall. I genuinely enjoyed completing the homework!",

        "Course is hard, make sure you are prepared for math, cause that is what this is. no bitcoins",
        "This course uses the ESNU grading system which combines with test scores to determine your final grade. Overall, I preferred this grading system since it encouraged learning through regrades. However, this is probably the most inconsistently graded course I have ever taken \u2013 depending on which TA graded a particular problem set, I would get a completely different grade, and never felt like I could predict how well I would do on a given problem. I could see this inconsistency most clearly in that students I collaborated with got drastically different grades on the same problems despite having similar solutions.",
        "I loved the course. The grading system was a bit different, and this has pros and cons, but I think the pros win out in the end. The concepts were challenging, but getting a good grade is less challenging with the wiggle room and the revision system.",
        "I felt like a lot more could have been covered and the pace could generally have been faster. A lot was repeated across multiple lectures.",
        "This course uses a non\u2013traditional ESNU grading scheme. This is helpful, since it allows you to make and learn from minor mistakes with essentially no harm to your grade.",
        "\u2013 feedback from homework assignments could have been more detailed",
        "I did not enjoy this class at all",
        "The class used an ESNU grading system which was helpful and I would say more fair than a traditional grading system.",
        "The grading for this course was not typical, and I personally really liked it. The standards were very clear, and it's basically possible for anyone to get an A if they put in the effort. Professor Cohen's intention was to maintain high standards with low stakes and to emphasize learning over grades, and I think this was very much accomplished. He also allows for sixty hours of late time throughout the quarter, which is hands down the best late policy I've ever experienced at this university. It was so helpful to be able to submit multiple things a bit late rather than having only one extension or dropped assignment like some courses have.",
        "Extremely difficult for me, but I appreciated the challenge",
        "I thought the ESNU grading system worked well for this course (though I\u2019d hate to have it in a more programming\u2013intensive course). I enjoyed this course a lot because I found it challenging while still very doable.",

        "Aloni is for the most part an excellent lecturer who writes interesting problems for psets.\n\nThe use of the ESNU grading scheme also made exams a lot less stressful.\n\nThe ability for students to submit revisions on past psets was also nice in that it incentivized students to clarify misconception on past topics.",

        "idk",
        "The lectures became significantly more helpful and engaging towards the second half of the course, in part because professor Cohen was better about answering questions (both on and offline) and making sure students really understood his answers. Even though I found the content significantly more difficult after the midterm, I found the improved teaching style made the class more enjoyable. If the entire course were taught in the same way it was taught in the last few weeks, I feel I would have been able to learn more.",
        "Not much aside from the consistency in TA's grading and laying out the expectations of each level clearly",
        "He could try to pace lectures a bit better as we frequently ran out of time towards the end of lecture.\n\nOther than that, keep up the good work!",
        "I would like if it was a little more clear what parts of the book were covered in lecture. This info was made available eventually, but not immediately.\n\nThis was not really a big deal for me. I am scraping the bottom for this question.",
        "I think some of the board work could have been better. Professor Cohen would often erase terms in an expression and replace them instead of rewriting them. A lot of lectures also included big recaps of the previous lecture that would take up a lot of time, which I didn't like. I think less time could be spent on the secret\u2013key stuff in order to make more time for some of the public\u2013key topics that were mentioned on the last day.",
        "The feedback for assignments was not entirely concrete. At times this was very helpful, since it gave me enough of a hint to solve the problem myself for a revision, but at times it would have been more helpful to have more instructional feedback, either because the feedback didn't help me understand what went wrong, or it simply wasn't a week I could afford to do revisions. That being said, I'm unsure how this could be changed without changing the revision policy, which itself was very beneficial to my learning.",
        "The grading scheme while promising, was extremely confusing, and felt like it encouraged \"gaming\" the system instead of learning. The feedback we got on psets was also not the most helpful",
        "Nothing.",

Often times I found myself having to learn more material from the book or relearn things because the notes from class weren't enough to do the homework.",
        "This was a good course, but some of the lectures were somewhat disorganized. I think a lot of it was because this was Professor Cohen's first time teaching the course this way, so he was figuring things out. He could have prepared for lectures a little better (sometimes he would underestimate how long things would take and end up rushing things, or he would be thinking on the spot of the best way to explain something). I also think his board work could be improved. Sometimes what he wrote would be hard to understand, especially for people who are less experienced with math, because he left out phrases like \"such that.\" It also always helps when professors label things with \"Definition,\" \"Theorem,\" \"Proposition,\" \"Proof Sketch,\" etc. Professor Cohen sometimes did this but not always.\n\nAlso, I think Professor Cohen didn't realize how he came across on Ed Discussion. He is a really nice guy in person, but he was pretty harsh on Ed. I don't think he was intending to be harsh, though. He just kind of acted like a computer in that when people posted things that were unclear or imprecise, he would act like he was unable to parse them. I understand wanting people to put thoughts into their posts, but probably being a bit kinder would be helpful so that people aren't afraid to ask questions.",
        "Prof. Cohen often prepared too much content to fit into each lecture, which led to many lectures feeling rushed. I often struggled to keep up in lecture, even if I could go back and understood what was being taught after some book reading. I think this class would be improved if each lecture covered a bit less so that all of the content is well\u2013explained, as opposed to bits and pieces being left out. I also would have appreciated more in\u2013class examples of what our proofs on assignments should look like, and for Prof. Cohen's chalkboard notes to be cleaner and bigger.",
        "Nothing. I wish the course (or quarters) were longer so I had more time to learn this, but that's not really his fault.",

The class consists of weekly 3\u2013hour seminars where we review everyone's progress and Dylan gives valuable feedback and told stories from his own experiences as an entrepreneur.

I took this class because I was interested in learning about startups, although I had a feeling they weren't really for me. I was right. I learned that making a startup is a ton of hard work, and not \"just sitting in the dark coding for 12 hours\" type of hard work. You have to sell yourself and your product. You need to be willing to bother people. You need to \"disrupt\" existing markets. It's hard. For many, it's worth it. I am proud of the work I did in this course, but it definitely made me anxious socially, which classes don't usually. It is a GOOD class though. Dylan is incredible.

Dylan (and the TAs) did an excellent job of making \"entrepreneurship\" sound less scary \u2013 it's not so much about the financial rewards and risks but instead, at least for me personally, an opportunity to connect with customers and solve real\u2013world problems. I came into this class unsure whether or not I had what it took to build a startup, but I'm leaving this class continuing to work on what we started.\n\nI will note that this is one of those classes where what you get out depends on how much work you are willing to put in.

Lots of time was spent discussing research results from a very high level, or talking about various types of hardware. Assignments had the potential to be interesting, and the actual class material we covered in them was illustrative, but they were incredibly frustrating to work on due to low level technical issues not related to the course.

Not enough intuition provided in my opinion, you must be really comfortable with notation and have an exceptionally good handle on statistics and probability to gain intuition on ML.

        "There were a couple of times where Yuxin's explanations assumed moderate\u2013to\u2013high level of knowledge which the majority of the class might not have. I think it might be useful to regularly to check whether the students are familiar with a certain concept before proceeding.",
        "Some lecture slides were rather incoherent in particular thinking about the start and discussion of perceptron loss/SVM in kernel lectures. The GAN lecture was honestly rather out of place, and I got very little from it. The homeworks seemed ok.\n\nI'm rather annoyed with the explanation of the generative models/LDA, not particularly at the teacher, but mainly at the fact that it seems that every textbook has something different to say about LDA / decision boundaries /fisher's LDA, and I wish there was a bit more in the course tying together what was covered in lectures, and how similar material is talked about/explained in the textbook.\n\nI don't know a single one of my peers who actually really truly understood what was really going on during the Gaussian Process lecture\u2013 it seemed rather out there, and just dropped the concept of a stochastic/gaussian process, and was actually rather difficult at first glance to see how it related to the kernel lectures preceding.\n\nIt's difficult to complain about the homework assignments in particular, since I have not really taken a ML class before, so I don't have a frame of reference. Perhaps all ML classes are this way, but it seems like all the \"theoretical\"/mathematical elements of the homework assignments weren't more computational than anything. Aside from the one homework assignment question talking about the variance shrinking of ridge estimators, I feel like many of the homework questions (written) were simple to provide much intuition, and could probably have been given as recommended questions to do, with more challenging questions for the actual written portion. But I don't suppose this is really too much to complain about.\nAll in all, I don't think it was a bad course though",
        "I think this course contained just the right amount of balance between theory and practice. I would not recommend a lot of changes in the structure.",

        "Yuhan Philip Liu was very good and very patient with questions, and provided a lot of feedback and intuition where necessary. He put up with a lot of the rather ridiculous questions I asked, and was generally well prepared and helpful",
        "The TAs Yilin, Yuhan and Hugh have been very prompt in answering my queries. Their responses to the discussion posts were very helpful in understanding the content taught in class and solving the assignment problems."

        "Prof. Ettinger is an extremely engaging lecturer. Did a very good job picking out interesting papers and managing class discussions. Felt like I learned a lot about how NLP works, and how it emerged. Absolutely is a class that is worth your time. Do the readings.\n\nThe programming component of this class is not particularly complex. There is an introduction to PyTorch but you won't be really be diving deep. Class is mostly about giving you a theoretical background. This is a consequence of the fact that it mixes CS and linguistics students. A lot of the programming exercises are about getting the linguistics students up to speed with Python. I honestly think that professors teaching electives shouldn't have to be walking students through the basics of programming. But that's a problem with how UChicago organizes the humanities/social sciences, not the fault of Prof. Ettinger. Long past due that there was a specific set of core programming courses for the social sciences/humanities.\n\nFamiliarity with the basics of linear algebra will be helpful. Vector spaces are a central component of how the bulk of models in the class, and its something that's hard to wrap your head around on the fly. If you don't know what a singular value decomposition is, learn it!",

        "The computational linguistic course was an enlightening experience that was made even better by the patient teaching style and impressive syllabus. The instructor's ability to break down complex concepts and explain them in simple terms made it easy to grasp the fundamental principles of computational linguistics. The syllabus was well\u2013structured and covered a broad range of topics, from morphology to syntax and semantics. Overall, the course both engaging and informative, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in the field of computational linguistics.",

      "Please elaborate on any of your responses above.": [
        "Great instructor overall",
        "Professor Ettinger is incredibly kind, knowledgeable, and passionate about the subject, and is very good at conducting discussions. However, I was personally expecting a class with more coding and implementation rather than a reading/discussion post/discussion based class. It ended up feeling more like a SOSC/Humanities class as a result. The concepts discussed were interesting, but reading and talking about other people\u2019s research only takes you so far.",
        "This course was underwhelming in every dimension. My frustration with the class is largely a result of how lectures were structured. Instead of covering the technical details of different language models, or teachnig us how to implement them in Python, the class is primarily discussion\u2013based. Since discussion is graded, lots of people felt pressured to speak in class, which resulted in the same comment being reiterated multiple times. This became worse after intermediate participation grades were released and lots of students got an underwhelming grade. As a function of class size (50+ students) and how the class is designed, excessive emphasis (and pressure) was put on students having to talk if they wanted decent grades. A few students went rogue (the two that come to mind both sat in the front row) and repeatedly talked without putting their hand up, or without contributing anything meaningful to the conversation. This lead to a dysfunctional environment. Particularly in the second half of the class, I only went to lectures to make sure I get credit for participation, I did not learn from some of my peers rambling on about topics that are tangentially related to the course materials. I would have preferred to learn about computational linguistics from the instructor instead. I am leaving the class disheartened. My goal was to learn more about computational linguistics in terms of both theory and code, but unfortunately, I failed to achieve either goal. I am also still waiting on feedback on my assignment that I submitted in week 2, exactly two months ago. The final project was group\u2013based, which was not communicated until after the add/drop deadline. If I knew this, I would have not taken the class. In general, I would not take this class again.",
        "discussions were forced during every class making it so that not much material was covered. she was very helpful during office hours and provided good feedback and insight. it was a bit difficult to participate every class as it is a large class and there are only so many things to say about a certain topic/question"

As someone coming in with a moderate data science background, I would have appreciated more sophisticated programming assignments. But I understand why that's something that is beyond the professor's control.\n\nI think that the final project could have had more explicit milestones/could have started earlier in the quarter.",
        "perhaps a little less emphasis on requirement of class participation. But i can also see the merit in getting people to speak",
        "No group projects please",
        "I would de\u2013emphasize the heavy discussion aspect of this class, as well as the heavy weight towards participation. With a class of 50+ people, most of class time consisted of everyone trying to get a word in, and as a result, we often had to rush through the lecture portion of the class. I would put heavier weight on the coding assignments and make them more tied to the concepts discussed in class. I would have appreciated if the assignments were graded faster, as it was hard to gauge my understanding and progress when we stopped getting feedback by late January,",
        "The class material should be more technical, and this is coming from a non\u2013CS person. The assignments felt detached from the lecture contents. Lectures should either consist of more teaching (instead of discussion), or the course should be reframed as a seminar, and allow fewer students. The current version with lots of students who are forced to speak in class is uncomfortable for many and does not yield much learning. These discussions are meaningless and repetitive, at the cost of learning actual materials.",
        "I wish this course was more challenging in terms of programming and mathematical assignments.",
        "I think less discussion and more lecture could sometimes be helpful. It often felt like we were rushing through the slides because there was so much of a focus on discussion.",
        "i wish the class a bit less heavy on participation grading wise (or was structured in a way that made it easier to participate without having to take up the time of the entire class perhaps through smaller discussions between groups or something). the assignments had a large jump in difficulty coding wise especially as someone with no experience so i wish she couldve spent some time in class going over coding things"

I think a much more useful format would be to have one long homework problem that walks you through how some important problem in field X was solved using information theory, and the parts we have to work out are how to use these tools to solve the problem. I think the homeworks were attempting to do this, but gave so little background or motivation that I found myself aimlessly applying concepts from class with no real idea as to why I was doing these things beyond it being the \"correct answer to the problem\".",
