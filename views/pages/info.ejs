          It's pretty easy to quickly scan through one course evaluation for
          what you want. Maybe 2, or 3. But when there are thousands of
          evaluations to sift through for all the courses you're considering,
          this method just doesn't seem feasible anymore. We use OpenAI's
          <a

          to summarize course evaluations from previous quarters with a focus on
          grading, workload, teaching style of the professor, and the level of
          difficulty for the course.

          We agree, the
          <a href="https://my.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">registrar site</a>
          is archaic in terms of user experience, hard to navigate, and, above
          all, can take up minutes of your time when it should only take
          seconds. We seek to provide easier navigation for browsing courses and
          evaluations. We are lacking in some features (e.g. labs/discussions
          for Autumn 2023 courses) and we'll work towards a system that will
          eventually replace the registrar site for general informational
          purposes.

        Running GPT-4 is time-consuming and expensive. To deliver the right
        value under limited time and resources, we decided to focus summarizing

        target the majority of the student population and deliver these
        summarizations to you before the Autumn 2023 quarter pre-registration.
        We will work in the coming weeks to onboard more evaluation
        summarizations onto this platform. If there are any courses that you
        feel should be summarized,
