Course staff made little effort to respond to Ed posts in a timely manner, and when responses were posted, they were curt and/or unhelpful.\\n\\nThe difficulty was contrived. There was no reason for the grading policy to be as unforgiving as it was (I say this having taken proper CS courses, which are far more meaningful and, interestingly, more lenient). The content in itself isn’t difficult. I mean, you’ll be self–studying AP stats for the latter half of the quarter, but that isn’t *so* bad.\\n\\nThe one thing that I will take away from this course is that I am glad I am not majoring in DS. My expectations were low to begin with (having read the course evals before registering), but what I endured this quarter was beyond absurd. If you’re minoring in DS like I am, I suppose it’s worth suffering through. Find a study group. While sharing answers wasn’t allowed, I suspect this wasn’t enforced as well as it should have been (which, given the woeful standards of this course, wasn’t surprising).\\n\\nThis course is in desperate need of revamping.

I know that the Data Science department is relatively new, and so the Intro courses are still being developed/tested.\\n1) I think it would be better to have an exam for the midterm, and a culminating project as the final, rather than the other way around. Overall, I feel like being given a real–world data set, applying the skills learned in class directly to analyze it using code + statistics, and communicating your findings is much more in the spirit of the course and the field than an exam. Honestly, having a report as the midterm and a paper/presentation as the final seems like a good idea.\\n2) I would change the extra credit received by the labs, or simply incorporate them into the homework (like having questions at the end that are worth extra credit), rather than having them be separate. I know that the way labs were graded changed partway through the course, and I agree with the changes made. However, sometimes it was hard to justify spending time doing a lab, when they were optional, were at most worth an extra 5%, and we could not turn in homework late. It seemed a better use of time to simply not do the lab and spend more time on the actual homework to get a better grade.\\n3) Focus more on the statistics part of the course. While the programming aspects of the course were covered very extensively, I felt that towards the end, the stats got introduced and sort of glossed over. Because I did not have a strong stats background – I was taking calculus at the time – it was a lot harder to apply them in code. I would in the future dedicate at least one probability + hypothesis testing homework where programming takes more of a backseat, and instead focuses on the actual math behind the code.'],\n",

She read every pre–made presentation word for word and did not add a single piece of additional insight to it in 10 weeks. Not only did not she not know the first thing about data science, she was not even capable enough to bullshit her way into tricking me that she knew anything about it either. She legitimately would struggle trying to complete the second pset assigned to us. If you read her ED discussion responses to important questions students had about the psets you would witness cold hard evidence of her inability. She is apparently a PHD and wrote our textbook so this makes me entirely question the source of her lack of competence toward teaching data science. One time I asked her \"how do I know the process for selecting the right amount of bins for a histogram\" expecting a formula or a method to accomplish that and she responded with \"you just have to understand the process of the data\", so to test her I said \"oh ok so I just estimate a number\" which is obviously not what you are supposed to do, and she said \"yea you seem to get it\" and left. I overheard a student asking her how to use a for loop to accomplish the simple task of putting items into different lists and she fumbled over her words and tried to come up with a sensible response so hard to the point where I genuinely felt bad. For every student after me\\'s sake and her own as well she needs to never ever teach a data science class again. People would ask her questions and she would legitimately respond by restating the question in a different format thinking she found her way out of answering. Not being a good teacher is one thing, not understanding the topic to its fullest extent is one thing, not knowing the topic well at all is one thing, but not knowing the topic well at all and not even having the wherewithal to be able to convince me that she knew the first thing about data science made me truly question why I spend so much money and time to go waste 50 of my minutes for something I could just be sent over email. She gave me a 73 on a midterm project that I later compared with students who received an 86 and a 95 and I had the exact same quality level of work if not better. I simply cannot comprehend how you can take off points on something you cannot even do yourself. I truly hope whatever research she is doing here is really, really, really, worth it because I would not subject her inability as a teacher to anyone who comes after me. I understand this is a new major to the college but I could take my 4 year old cousin and give him 24 hours to study the subject and he would likely be able to offer more additional insight than what is given in the slides than she did. I am trying to major in data science and this instructor makes me rethink if this is the right school to do that at if I am being entirely honest, and if this type of instruction continues I will relay that information to anyone and everyone who should hear it.

It's not because of our bleak futures or a difficult job market. The suffering of young people today, their mental health problems, and the lives lost to suicide are entirely attributable to the environment created for students by courses such as these. Young people can't thrive in an alienated and inhumane environment. Please, if you are thinking about how to improve education in the future, don't make small changes like the grading system. Only a total reconceptualization of how you actually do the job of educating and how that education is structured can help address the mental crisis and stop people from taking their lives.\\n\\nI know that the department is trying to fix these things.

I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way about the courses, and only implore those engaged in the planning and structuring of STEM education at the university to feel personally responsible for the consequences that the courses they create and teach have on the lives of their students. It doesn't have to be this way and if you take moral responsibility for how education is structured as a collective then it can actually be changed.

Unique grading system that takes a second to get used to, but relatively easy to track where you fall for a final grade. It is very, very difficult to receive a flat A.

The grading scheme in this course is incredibly strict for an introduction course. To get an A in this course, you not only need to get 100 on all homework but have perfectly clean code for almost all of them as well. For a beginner, this is almost impossible. I understand that codes should all be able to run near perfectly in order for a satisfactory score to be given, but I think using the SNU scale actually eliminates partial credit for work done. For example, let\\'s say someone gets 80% of all their code running and has mostly clean code. This doesn\\'t sound bad until you actually read the grading scheme because an 80% actually gets you an N score on most assignments, meaning that you are actually in danger of failing this course unless you get almost a 100 on the paper exams. There is a huge disparity in the level of difficulty of material covered in class and the actual homework assignments. I think you should spend more time actually doing difficult questions in class or perhaps giving some hints. I know that those who can know coding beforehand may find it boring, but this class is currently heavily skewed towards these people.

       "    'Lectures were extremely applicable and useful. Professor Elmore was excellent at answering any questions we had about what he was doing. During each lecture he would simply show examples of whatever data structure or concept we were learning about, implementing them in ipython and considering different methods, applications for the structure, and thus understanding how the structure worked and why it was relevant. The lectures were thus extremely useful, whether for the nature of programming or otherwise, because I felt equipped by not just the notes I took from lecture but also by seeing the thought process behind the application of each object to apply myself with the homework. The homework was also extremely useful. It emphasized concrete uses of what we were learning, which helped me think about real–life applications of the knowledge (besides enjoying learning about these concepts for their own sake). It also gave me ample opportunity to make mistakes, to implement the objects we learned about many times, and to approximate pythonic code. Finally, however, some of the problems were truly challenging, forcing me to better understand the problem I was trying to solve, its applications to other problems in the same problem set, and thus making me a better programmer. I must say that the projects felt simply like glorified homework assignments––however, they had the unified theme of solving the task of creating a library hub, which I suppose warrants to some extent the idea of calling them projects. In addition, some assignment problems had vague wording that failed to specify the requirements of the solution––specifically, split_lines on HW 4 did not detail what to do when the string was greater than the length––this was by necessity learned through trial and error with pytest. Thus when on the final we had to create a dictionary with values of None for each index in the list that we were given, I had no trouble doing so, because the assignments we had been given had entailed similar processes. The discussion sections, although my TA was kind and helpful, did not really help much with my understanding until the last one––and even then, I had missed a couple of relevant lectures, so it was possible that I would have seen similar examples previously otherwise. They simply felt like a repetition of what we had already learned. I think if the discussion sections were optional, the course overall would adapt itself more to different feelings of comfort with the material. As a final note: I did NOT feel like the midterm or final were \"out to get me\" or meant to \"weed me out\" or \"tank my grade\". I don\\'t believe any of the problems went beyond the scope of what we would necessarily have learned by completing the homeworks, and thus I don\\'t think any content on the midterm or final was unfair as far as I can remember.',\n",

I find in person office hour completely useless (due to extreme inefficiency) so the instructors should think more about how to improve that experience. However, lots of gratitude for instructors and TAs as their help over Ed is extremely essential to my learning.\\nExams: okay sure we need exams but can we talk about the fact that we are writing code on paper? It is an absurd practice. My roommate saw my scratch papers and asked why I wrote code on paper and I told her that I had to practice writing code on paper correctly for the exam. This is quite absurd. But if this has to continue being the case, can we get more practice of writing code on paper correctly from the class? It is one thing to be able to write code on laptop and debug to make sure everything works and another thing to write code on paper without debugging and still get everything to work. For example, maybe we need 2h of discussion sessions every week. Or, we should have some weekly quizzes (not graded) where students are required to write codes down on paper.

       "    'The office hours structure towards the end was terrible. People had to strategize when they would go into office hours to get help on the project. For example, if you have a question that you could not solve even with ED, you had to consider whether to try getting into office hours and risk not getting into future office hours in the next day or two or week (thus preventing you from getting help on an EVEN harder problem later on) or save your office hours \"pass\" for the EVEN harder problem later on. Basically, you could be really struggling with your current problem but have to consider whether it may be the hardest problem you will come across—you will get into office hours like twice max so you had to use them wisely. Also, you could wait the whole day and not get into office hours. My friend had not gone to OH for the whole week and still had to wait two days to get in. You only have a week and a half or so for each project so there really is not much time to sit around being stuck. Also, office hours were 30 minute sessions for ~5 people which is not that much time per person. It takes a while to understand the problem, let alone fix it. The professors were really unhelpful on ED while the TAs were mostly helpful. The professors never really answered your questions and gave either vague statements or more questions (also vague) as responses. The test cases for the project were also pretty bad and did not cover all scenarios. The way the test cases were written was really hard to understand—you spent more time deciphering what you were testing rather than deciphering what the test case yielded in your code. The class moved a little fast considering how little support—you could barely get any help. I think the professors should be less stingy with their help and provide clear answers to questions; e.g. clarification questions on doc–strings for functions we are supposed to write. How are we supposed to write the function if the doc–string is vague and we do not even know what the function is supposed to do? I literally showed my CS professor the doc–string for a function on the project and even they could not understand what the function was supposed to do??? (Another prof wrote the doc–string apparently) Then for a question about a doc–string that the professors refuse to clarify on ED, I now have to consider whether to waste my one of maybe two chances of getting into office hours on a not–that–even–complicated question??

The weekly homework assignments were very good for solidifying knowledge, and I appreciated the SNU grading scheme and the auto–grader for code submission grades so that I didn't feel as stressed about every little point. Code quality grades were a bit stressful just b/c I was always confused as to how they were graded though. Finally, exams were pretty reasonable given the material covered.

The homeworks are time consuming, but they really do help foster a better understanding of the concepts you learn each week. TAs and profs are also super helpful in office hours.

Otherwise, it was a great course\",\n",

       "    \"If you know nothing about Python before 141, you should definitely brush up on it beforehand, because it will save you many many hours of having to learn it on the fly, which from what I've seen with friends taking the course, is incredible time consuming\",\n",
       "    'I feel as though I learned a ton from the projects. However, there were points where I was just like ‘this isn’t working, & I really don’t understand why’. Ed was a great resource & faculty was very active in answering questions, but this didn’t stop me from being stuck on one step for at times 10 hours at a time. I get that I’m a senior taking this course, but I don’t even know if I’d find this class accessible if I were a freshman & extra gung ho (& I’m a math major). I really just wanted to learn a little bit about how to code! & I feel as though I should have an accessible option to do this in college (yes I understand that this is the University of Chicago). For one, I wish that course staff could find a way to not set arbitrary benchmarks on assignments & set a grading scale that (I’d be willing to guess) at least 10% of the students fell off of; only for us to later learn that this scale is flexible (which is very helpful but doesn’t change the fact that I’ve been very stressed the last 4 weeks). Really, I feel as though my central issue with the course was that institutionally this class really is not accessible. To hear students mumble under their breath thoughts of self harm is not only an obvious sign that something here is wrong, but such a culture can be triggering for other students that just happen to be in office hours. Course staff as individuals really did want us to succeed. Whenever you could talk to them in office hours or on Ed, it was clear that you guys want to help us. But seriously, the current culture of CSMC 141 is the least healthy I have seen in my college experience as a senior. & it seems to me that you’re all aware that we have wanted to lose our minds this entire quarter, but agreed at the beginning of the quarter that your standards were going to be your standards. I think that in a language learning class, the framework should be flexible. This is based on the core belief that we’re a bunch of motivated people, who are going to try our best at learning coding. [For instance many math classes have it where (simplistically) it’s either 50% homework, 50% final, or, if your grade works out better this way, is 100% final. In our case, say 20% projects 10% discussion attendance & 70% exam based. I feel as though something more like this would be incredibly helpful for enabling students to learn from the course, & find ways of learning CS that are good for them while still meeting y’all’s standards, but not lose their minds along the way.\\n\\nAlso, the virtual queue for office hours led to way more cheating, for the record. Crazy that frustrated students who are (1) unsure if they will ever get help (2) are under the impression that they are about to fail a college course & (3) now left unsupervised are likely to band together. The most annoyed I ever was in this course was overhearing a group of students (I’m nosy) saying they were all at 100 on project 1, opting to band together, & managing to edit each other’s code to get to 180 each after like an hour. After an hour I was still exactly where I had started, & by the end of the day of S/N & just that whole process was really annoying, but you’re aware a ton of other people aren’t acting ethically, are doing better as a result, & are unlikely to be caught, make you feel like you’re inherently at a disadvantage in the course for trying to interpret the guidelines literally.',\n",

After a week of that, we went into principles of software design, which is nice but could have been done in far fewer classes or completely covered in notes – there's no reason to waste weeks of valuable class time on content that I spend a couple hours reading about and understand fully. mypy was a handy tool but then we spent an entire class learning about the features of PyCharm which highkey felt like a paid advertisement.

I think the course could have definitely covered more content than it did, CS 141 did the bulk of the conceptual work.

I think in future iterations the lectures should continue to focus on more theory and what we were doing in the first half. We could still have a project that teaches us the development heuristics, working as a team etc. I will say that this course is pretty trivial compared to 141 due to the laissez discussion of software development and chill project.

       "    'These comments are about the course structure, NOT about Professor Morgan. Although Prof. Morgan was a great instructor, the course content was standardized across the 6 sections and its design was completely horrible and unhelpful.\\n\\nFirstly, the course lectures (which were standardized across CS 142) were far too theoretical and abstract. There were few examples of code and students would be expected to pick up completely new concepts and apply them to homework immediately that weekend without any time to digest the implementation details. Although this was alright for me with some background in trees and graphs, I experienced this first–hand during the week on numpy and pandas, when we were expected to get used to the various libraries and functions within the span of days. This is rather unrealistic and induces unnecessary stress.\\n\\nSecondly, the course lectures on software development felt like an afterthought which simply took away lecture time from more relevant topics. (Again, this is not Prof. Morgan\\'s fault.) Instead of focusing on other more interesting ideas like data structures and functional programming, we spent extended lectures discussing the ideation process without any concrete way to implement these ideas in our code.\\n\\nThirdly, the course project itself was not well integrated into the modules on software development. The project details came far too late and we were given one week to flesh out the implementation details. Furthermore, the experience of collaboration in every group was very different and in some groups, one member\\'s lack of adherence to the design classes /methods could jeopardize other members\\' code and implementation. Hence, there is no objective way to judge the integration achieved within the group. Certain members are far more reliant on other members and are simply left to the mercy of their unexpected and unannounced changes.\\n\\nFourthly, the TAs for the course were very unprofessional and inconsistent with their advice. One TA told us that certain features of our design were good, before another TA informed us next week that we would need to revise and revamp them. During code reviews, the TAs seem unsure of their advice and flip–flop between their recommendations. There needs to be more thorough and cosistent training for the TAs so that we can get the advice we need during office hours.\\n\\nLastly, the grading for the course is far too strict. We need all \"S\"s on our code and a grade of 90 on the midterm, which means consistent work throughout the quarter can be derailed by just one sub–par showing. This creates unnecessary stress and does not reflect the overall coding ability of a student. Instead, grading should be cumulative so students have a chance to redeem themselves if they improve their performance.',\n",

I went to the first 3, but every time, it consisted of me showing up to a room full of other students in other classes doing other work, with no TA in sight (I couldn\\'t tell you what they looked like), and just doing the work assigned on a computer with no real organization.\\n\\nI imagine this is the reason why most students didn\\'t show up to lab near the end. There was no reason to, since you\\'d gain just as much by doing the lab on your own time.',\n",

       "    \"Lectures were very good. Adam Shaw was a fantastic lecturer and made them very informative, clear, concise, and digestible. I found homework to be very good at solidifying what I learned during lecture, and generally really enjoyed solving the problems they presented. They covered the material well, and were generally a very good length. I thought that the midterm quiz and final exam were very reasonable as well. Ed was helpful for keeping up with questions and general course information, but I don't think the TAs/Profs were as helpful on Ed this quarter vs. 141 and 142. Overall, I found the course to be very good and educational though.\\n\\nOffice Hours were very good, but maybe consider stacking up more office hours and TAs on days/hours prior to homeworks being due, as this is when demand got high. I understand that it's not the course staff's responsibility to be there and that it is the students' fault for not planning ahead, but inevitably, more students are going to show up to office hours the two days before the problem set is due vs. the two days after the problem set is assigned. Overall though, office hours were helpful and informative.\\n\\nMy first gripe is with homework grading. I understand why Prof. Shaw doesn't give us tests to run our homework code through, but if you're ALSO not going to share them with us afterwards, nor have the TAs leave feedback on our code after grading, then there is NO WAY we can learn from our mistakes...? When the autograders were published right before the final exam, I found issues in my code that the TAs didn't explain, and found myself trying to understand why I lost points on things the day before the exam. Plus, I lost points on homeworks for issues that had to do with the clarity of the homework instructions –– not with an issue in my code. It took one line for me to fix a problem that cost me 8 points on the homework –– and the only reason it wasn't there in the first place was because the homework instructions weren't clear about the requirements for inputs.\\n\\nI think a good middle ground for homework grading would be to have the autograder on Gradescope tell us how many points we lost, and then we can go back and correct it without knowing what the actual tests were –– just knowing something isn't right in our code.\\n\\nMy second gripe was with labs. I think that labs were SOMETIMES informative and helpful. The first few labs and the lab on criterion and valgrind were good, but some of them were just kinda useless? I don't know why we had a lab on unions when we could just do unions in class. Similarly with the ncols labs. They were generally well structured, but it just felt like the Professors were trying to get us to learn more that they didn't cover in lecture. And for some reason, we had a labs EVERY week, including weeks 1 and 9? I understand that you want us to learn more, but like, no other department has NINE labs in a quarter, that's kind of absurd. I don't know why we're going to lab the day before our final problem set is due to learn a NEW subject which you said we need to learn because its going to be on the exam? And then, then labs are optional, but the Profs seem to get annoyed when we don't go during the midterm week or something...? and then tell us we need to go because the material is going to be on the exam? I don't know. Plus, then one of the labs was literally the homework, which was annoying.\\n\\nI think the labs are good, but don't have nine of them. Have six or seven, and cut out the lab subjects that were clearly put there because you couldn't think of anything else to teach us. I think the bytes/colorpatch lab was good, the pointers lab was extremely helpful, I liked the criterion and valgrind labs, and the reading P3/P6 lab was good, but it was annoying that we then needed it for the homework without prior notice.\",\n",

       "   'Additional comments about the course:': ['While Adam Shaw is excellent, CMSC 14300 is a bit of a mixed–bag compared to 14200 and 14100.\\n\\nOverall, it felt like 14300 was way less organized than 14200 and 14100. At times, it felt like Adam Shaw was pretty much doing everything aside from the grading. Responding to Ed posts, writing up the homework, writing up the labs... it all seemed to be from him alone, which made me wonder why the course didn\\'t have more manpower dedicated to it like 14200 did.\\n\\nIn 14200 and 14100, your \"correctness\" grade on homework was based on given autograders. It\\'s the same in 14300, but this time, students AREN\\'T given the autograder with which they\\'ll be tested on. Instead, students have to come up with their own tests, encouraging us to become better programmers by anticipating edge–case scenarios.\\n\\nAdmittedly, having to come up with bulletproof code that passes all my own tests was a lot of fun, and it did make me a much better programmer. But when we\\'re tested on an autograder we have no access to, it\\'s really discouraging receiving a really low grade despite all the work put into your own tests because there was a minor slip–up between what the autograder expected and what you expected. Minor discrepancies like \"you needed to put a \\'–\\' character, not a \\'_\\' character\" often causes the autograder\\'s tests to fail, slapping the student in the face with a poor grade. Yes, the student can request a regrade, but there really needs to be a better way for students to feel comfortable in the work they submit like with 14100/14200.\\n\\nI also almost never received feedback on the quality of my code. I\\'m absolutely certain I did not submit perfectly written code throughout the quarter, yet a TA never provided any constructive feedback of my work on Gradescope.\\n\\nHomework was graded incredibly slowly. Beyond HW 1, it often took around 2–weeks or more to receive a grade back. You can imagine how frustrating this was, when after 2 weeks you finally receive a grade back, and all you see is a series of autograder failures with no TA comments despite all your own self–testing. (bearing in mind HW is 60% of the final grade!!!)\\n\\nThe textbook for this course is amazing. Highly encourage reading K&R, it\\'s an excellent way to dive into C with prior programming experience.\\n\\nOverall, CMSC 14300 with Adam Shaw was great and the content was fascinating, but it\\'s plagued by a lot of annoying logistical issues that stem from poor organization.\\nI encourage the CS Department to keep working at improving the intro CS sequence, as they\\'ve done a really good job so far with 14100 and 14200, props to them.',\n",

It breaks many guidelines laid out in the CS Department C Style Guide, and IMO makes his code hard to read. This also bleeds into documentation.

I.e. questions about grading mistakes was a big one. If you're not going to publish autograders until a few days before the exam, and going to take a few weeks to grade homework, I don't think it's fair to be upset with students who have concerns about the homework content, the grading schemes, or the grading of their individual homework, since these are all issues that they couldn't have known about until after we received grades and the autograders for the homework, which course staff took over a month to release. I understand that the final exam is in a day and you're busy, but so are we, and your business arises from your failure to prepare properly, not our failure to engage with the course. I generally tend to agree that it is usually the students' fault when things aren't organized or responded to well, but in this case, I do think it was a failure on the course staff.\\n\\nI also want to reiterate my comments about labs –– make six or seven of them and pick the best ones. Nine labs is absurd, and lowkey gaslighting us into feeling like we need to go to all the labs because all of the material is going to be covered on the exam is annoying.\\n\\nLast thing I want to mention is that I think there should be more consistency between sections. I loved Prof. Shaw's lectures, but the other professor used lecture slides which went into a lot of depth about some things that Prof. Shaw didn't cover. It's nerve–wracking prior to exams to feel like we missed some of the material that's going to be on the exam because we didn't have the same lecture slides / same lectures.

       "    \"While Professor Nakagaki and the TAs were very nice and helpful, I felt like the curriculum overall was very badly designed. It was not what I expected at all. This can't be blamed on Nakagaki since the slides are entirely designed by the other professor, Pedro. I felt like there was no meaningful order, it was just a seemingly very sporadic and illogical sample of random areas related to human–computer interaction, based on the professor’s personal interests. It was not a comprehensive introduction to HCI at all. Even worse, I felt like the content of every lecture was shallow enough that I can just read a random Google search article or watch a 15 minute Youtube video and learn more. A lot of the examples of research given were based in Nakagaki and Pedro’s labs, which is nice, but I would’ve appreciated a broader perspective.\\n\\nWe would also sometimes spend a lot of time going into detail on topics that did not feel very relevant. For example, in a lecture about UI in VR, we spent way too much time going into detail about how the human eye and eyesight worked (like, how light rays refract and the different types of cells in the eye). There were two lectures on prototyping which could’ve been covered in 30 minutes and some helpful reading assignments. And why is prototyping even chosen for human–computer interaction? I understand that prototyping is necessary for user studies, but do we really need to go into such detail on it? We also spent one lecture on project 1 feedback, but this feedback could’ve just been given online.\\n\\nI expected readings on important HCI areas, papers or theory, but there were none. I’m very confused about this aspect of the course, since in my experience, textbooks and papers are integral parts of any STEM course, and I usually learn a lot from those. Not sure why the course designer could not be bothered to assign at least some reading.\\n\\nFurthermore, the grading for homeworks was very unclear. I know that since this is a design–focused class it's hard to specify what you are looking for in the project without giving away the answer, but it was just so vague. Something like a grading rubric would’ve been very helpful.\\n\\nThe projects did not feel particularly helpful or relevant to human–computer interaction. It felt very random too. Project 1 was a user study, and it was particularly unfair since different groups were assigned different user studies, and some studies were just harder to achieve a higher grade on. Based on what topic you are assigned, you do your project using a simple javascript web–app, or spend hours trying to learn Swift and get the Xcode environment to work. The instructions were very vague.\\n\\nProject 2 was a VR diving game, and it felt like a lot of the time was wasted on setting up the equipment and just regular programming or learning C# in Unity instead of human–computer interaction. The choice of a 3D VR game Unity is also rather dubious, since it probably gives the least applicable skills. Most of us don’t have a $300 VR headset, and unless you’re going into VR game design, it's not clear how we can use the skills learned on other things. Yes, we did learn UI design skills, but this could’ve been done with designing a website or a more useful web–app without wasting hours on busy work on the Oculus.\\n\\nProject 3 was called “eyes free pong”, where you make a pong game that you play without eyes. Again, since there was only one lecture on accessibility, I’m not sure why the project should be on this. Again, the instructions were very vague and confusing. It was unclear what parts of the starter code should be modified and what parts shouldn’t. Again, the project was much easier or harder based on your computer hardware, making it very unfair. The starter code contained a Google speech–to–text–API that was VERY laggy and sometimes would just not work, rendering it impossible to test your code. I’m not sure why the instructor did not take this into consideration and use an offline API in the starter code. Also, they seem to think that if your computer can’t run the libraries they used, then you should just go to CSIL, not considering that if everyone goes to CSIL for a speech–to–text recognition project and sits side by side shouts at their computer, the background would be very loud and the program would fail.\\n\\nAlso, my group was assigned “eyes free emojis”, for project 1, so it just felt like a lot of this course was about “eyes free” which is again, very random and narrow considering the entire field of human–computer interaction.\",\n",

The homework gave us an interesting way to experiment with those principles. The first project was a great way to introduce us to user study design. The second project was great at getting us to think about design principles in prototyping, but was not effective as a way to get us to think about refining that prototype in actual implementation, which I suspect was one of its main goals.\\nThe feedback on assignments was the most consistently helpful I've had in any course in the University, it was detailed in explaining both what worked well and where we could improve in future assignments.\",\n",

It seemed like Professor Nakagaki had no say in how the course was designed, on assignments, or extensions. Speaking of Pedro, I don’t know how good of a lecturer he is, but he is definitely very strange and unreasonable. Someone from his other class said he is “a little bit crazy”. First, he refuses to use a Ed/Canvas/discussion forum and insists that everything be done through email, meaning that students can’t see the questions of other students, and students can’t help each other. Second, he is extremely disconnected from reality. When I emailed him about unfairness in the project design, he said that if I want to code on my laptop, I should buy an architecture that is more widely supported :) He was rather rude and condescending in his emails to me. It seems like his ego is getting in the way of actually helping students. Also he gave extensions to some students but said “no extensions, that’s unfair to other students” to others. Overall a very confusing person to deal with.\\n\\nHe seems to think that forcing students to remain on campus and go to CSIL during thanksgiving break is an acceptable method of completing the project, failing to consider that 1) thanksgiving break is break 2) students literally are flying home to their families 3) CSIL is actually closed from Thursday to Sunday. Also, I know that he wanted the course to be fun with the “diver expo” and the “pong tournament”, but is this really what provides the best learning outcome/ the best use of class time? It’s nice when instructors make the course fun, but this should not be done at the cost of actual learning. I can’t help but wonder, is he really helping his students, or just designing a class that he thinks is cool and quirky and ‘fun’ (it would be more cool if it is fair)?\\n\\nAlso, Ken’s class had a Slack channel, and when someone asked for an extension on project 3 (and received a lot of agreement from other students), his message just got deleted from the channel by the TA.

       "    \"The second project (VR diver) wasn't structured very well. We repeatedly ran into issues that objects in VR did not seem to appear in the same locations as in Unity 3D. This led to times where we would need to rebuild and restart the VR environment dozens of times just to position an object on screen. Due to the slow process of rebuilding the environment, this could mean hours of time testing the position before we could even check if a feature worked. Because of this, rather than focusing on the actual iterative design of the UI, the project mainly became about desperately trying to get each UI element we designed to actually be visible. Additionally, we regularly ran into issues with the Oculi, the hand tracking often couldn't handle having two hands near each other, which caused issues if you wanted to attach any UI elements to the hand. I think reducing the number of elements necessary in the design (for instance, saying that you need to design at least 8 of the 10 elements), giving more time, or having the UI design be outside of VR would have helped.\\n\\nThe lectures at times felt like they went a bit off track when they discussed the professors' lab work.

I understand that one of the purposes of letting students figure it out is that this is a vital part of robotics programming, I get it, but there were some PHD level students in _robotics_ that were in our class as well. It is unfair whenever they get to debug in a couple hours, and the rest of us who are truly new to robotics have to do more.

If that wasn't enough, the TAs made an error in grading out first lab, so we still don't have these grades by ninth week. I sent an email asking when to expect them to come out, and I have not gotten a response.\\n\\nI'd say about half the class has dropped out of this course by now. The material is pretty difficult and the labs are lengthy and annoying. This class was worse than CS 154. I would not recommend taking it.\",\n",
       "    \"The content and labs were super interesting and I really enjoyed this class, however it was extremely poorly structured, with the rubrics by which labs would be tested unclear, and both the instructions for the lab and the ta's understanding of the lab was often confusing and contradictory. Additionally the tester file and the exemplar simulator which we used to test the labs spontaneously broke for multiple people. This class had the highest dropout rate out of any class I have been in, but was genuinely pretty fun.\",\n",

They never reply to Ed discussion messages on time (and none of the few replies had been helpful).\",\n",
       "    \"Even though the course material is interesting and the professor is really knowledgeable and helpful, the organization of labs was very disappointing. Labs had the majority of the grade, but none of them were graded until week 7, by which point we had submitted three labs that built on each other (so if something is wrong in the first one, it would impact later labs and we wouldn't know how). The TA's weren't very responsive, especially when asked about grading and would show up late to office hours at the times I went. The TA's would also give wrong answers for the labs, so a lot of people reached a point where they just didn't care about the class anymore and would do whatever because we weren't given any correct answers or grades for the majority of the quarter.\",\n",

This made it very difficult for honestly dumb reasons (sometimes I spent hours debugging their reference simulator, which had errors in it, before I could even begin testing my own code)\\n\\nalso, for a course where the labs build off of each other, it was a bit ridiculous that we received our grades over a month after we submitted assignments.\",\n",
       "    \"I think there's a serious issue with how the course is organized, and it has to do with the labs.\\n\\nThere are 4 labs, centered around building up a simulator of an ARM microprocessor and implementing features like caching, branch prediction, and pipelining that you learn about in lecture. They're cumulative and worth 60% of the total grade in the class. The way you're graded in the labs is by comparing the step–by–step output of your simulator with a reference simulator. Both their internal states must match exactly, at every point in time.\\n\\nThe issue is that the reference simulator is a complete black box, you are provided zero insight into its design, and the exact behavioral specifications of the reference simulator are unclear and ambiguous in the lab descriptions.\\n\\nWhenever you do run into an issue, it's almost never because you misunderstand the material or included a bug in your code––it's because you made a different design assumption (that was not mentioned in the lab document) about the exact timing of certain actions. Because the simulation routine is quite complicated and there are many different abstract layers to simulate, it's often unclear exactly where your simulator differs from the reference, just that it somehow leads to a different state at X point in time. The stringent requirements to exactly match the reference simulator means that this difference is actually incredibly important, and you will be penalized, often quite heavily, on any mismatch. You basically have to puzzle out what is expected of you by trying to guess what design assumptions and specifications went into the reference simulator.\\n\\nThe cherry on top is that the reference simulator itself has bugs/inconsistent behavior in it, and you have to parse out what is a bug and what is expected behavior based off specifications you don't have.\\n\\nI want to preface this by saying I'm someone who loved 154, and this course is ostensibly 154++. The lectures were amazing and the material is incredibly interesting, but given the labs and grading system, I don't think you should take this course as it currently stands. It's more frustrating than educational, and the vast majority of your time will be spent banging your head against a black box instead of learning the material.\",\n",

Further, feedback/grades on labs came so late that you weren't able to fix mistakes you made on earlier ones.

Ugghh.\\n\\nThere are 4 labs: make a single cycle processor, make it pipelined, add branch prediction, add cache behavior. Each one builds on the last. But the grading is done against a reference simulator. We\\'re expected to match the ref\\'s behavior cycle–for–cycle. Which is a pain, but okay, fair. But the reference simulator is a black box, and when you\\'re not matching it, it\\'s hard to know if that\\'s a bug in your code or if there\\'s something you didn\\'t understand––especially because we\\'re writing a serial simulation of a parallel pipeline, so some \"this happens now\" things need to be delayed until the end of the cycle. It encourages throwing stuff at the wall to see if it sticks. And for lab4, the ref sim is just actually buggy and inconsistent. Don\\'t know why. TAs acknowledged as much, so that\\'s great. Final issue was grading and feedback. Lab 1 grades were released a few days before lab3 and the rest were even later. No actual feedback or explanation of what might be wrong. Also responses to questions on Ed were slow, which made it that much harder to know what the simulator was doing or how it\\'s supposed to work.\\n\\nNow, given all that you might expect me to hate the course. But I enjoyed it. The stuff we\\'re actually learning in lectures and doing in labs is interesting and I had fun working on it.

Not everyone has 25–35+ hours for projects per week on top of readings and lecture, especially considering we have other classes. It's admirable that they want us to learn so much, but it's too much information in too little time to be learned effectively, especially considering how much we had to do to learn OUTSIDE of class in doing these assignments. This is the first course in my life I've turned in late assignments. My time and effort doesn't feel respected. It doesn't feel like we were set up to succeed or that learning was the key priority in this class so much as stack ranking us and putting us through an incredible amount of stress.

Alternatively, some questions in midterm and final that are geared more toward system designs rather than the technical details could be given in the form of bi–weekly take–home quizzes, which I think would achieve the same purpose as having midterm and final, but with a lot less stress induced on students.',\n",

Honestly, it\\'s a little unbelievable, but after making it through you realize that you are more talented than you thought.\\nII. The assignments were an absolute mess. Not every assignment was bad, in fact I think there were a couple that were even amazing and genius, but every single one was well over >20 hours (for me and for many other people. We use a forum called \"Campuswire\" [similar to Piazza, Ed, etc. but better] and on this forum there were multiple attempts to communicate this to the Professors throughout the quarter (very brave students felt that they should speak up about this). For instance let me go into detail about a specific assignment regarding Password Cracking. There will be a similar pattern to all assingments (with the exception of one), I can summarize the main point in a single or couple sentences but the assignment becomes just time–consuming to accomplish (despite knowing what to do). So for this one, the idea is simple: MD5 is super bad! You can crack million of these hashes per second, meaning that if people get their hands on the hashes, they will get your password. Easy enough to understand right? Now comes the \"fun\" part: download hashcat on your computer and decrypt hashes that you find on the assingment. My computer only ran 10k Hashes per second. Guess what? There are people with Gaming Computer that can run 10 Million Hashes per second. I didn\\'t realize CSIL machines ran faster, but I came to learn of this because people were leaving CSIL machines online and leaving Sticky Notes to not turn off. Why is this possible? Becuase with Hashcat you just give it a rule and then it will continue to hash until it has finished the rule. This can just take hours, so you are just sitting and staring at a screen to finish. There are better strategies, sure. And I think that\\'s the point of the assingment. But after I moved to the CSIL machines (which ran 80x faster than my computer), I finished in 3–4 hours. So I wasted 2 whole days with my computer not turning off, where my strategies were great, but I just don\\'t have the power.\\nNow I\\'ll give another example of this: Crib Dragging in part of an assingment. After you learn what crib dragging is (which is not that difficult, just have to look at logic statements again), you have to implement. I cannot begin to describe how tiresome this process was. I knew that my attack was working, I was getting through and uncovering the sentences. But it still took upwards of 4 hours just to get the sentences. Now, in the defense of the course, professors said that students could look up the sentences online after they have reached a certain point, reducing the assingment time significantly.',\n",

I enjoyed the freedom of the final project. The prof and the TA clearly put in a heroic amount of work to make the class function at all. On the other hand, I think too many hours were expected of students outside of class/lab and not all the assignments seemed necessary for learning the material. For example, one assignment where we had to take apart a piece of old electronics required 10–12 hours of work and we only had 2 days to do it, which seemed unreasonable. I think the solution to this is to limit assignments like these to the lab time –– a two hour lab would have been plenty of time to take apart the electronics and get a sense of understanding what's inside. The full cataloguing + slideshow + blog post was overkill. Some of the earlier labs included mini lectures –– I also don't think any lab time should be spent on lecture, really it should be for working on these assignments. Lastly, to really make this course effective would require many more TAs (maybe 5 total). There were points where I was quite lost and would have loved to chat with a TA during TA hours (there were no TA hours) –– while I could email questions, sometimes when you're sufficiently confused there's no way to condense the question into an email and the responses to the emails could be quite short.\",\n",

We regularly did not have enough soldering stations for students to finish their assignments in the time frame that was convenient to them. Also, the fact that this class is a wiki and not a canvas course added unnecessary complexity. Canvas courses don\\'t require me to remember the class website password nor do they require me to hunt down where the submission link is for a particular assignment.\\n\\nAlso, I would like a syllabus that tells me how much each assignment is worth for my grade. The grading for this class seems very fair, however without a full breakdown I don\\'t know where I stand. Honestly, given the fact that this is a project course, I would advocate to change the grading style to a completion + effort style instead of a \"correct–ness\" style. My feeling is that Pedro kinda does a mix of both but the latter style would allow me/future students to push themselves in technical complexity.',\n",
       "    \"okay, so a few things to unpack here:\\n– first, prof. lopes is really nice in person (i.e. very willing to explain concepts to you if you ask), but somehow comes off as mean over email. I'm not the only student who has had this experience.\\n– this class only has CMSC15400 as a prerequisite. however, it would be greatly beneficial if you had prior experience with electronics before coming into this class. I had no prior experience whatsoever (the last time I even vaguely touched E&M was in high school and I remembered nothing from it) and felt like I was thrown into the deep end from assignment 1. it got better over the quarter, but I feel like the folks who had prior electronics experience were overall much more comfortable than those without it. this kind of knowledge and experience disparity really does make a significant difference; there was only so much help you could get (office hours was essentially the lab, which is a couple hours per week), and everyone was fighting over resources. at times, it felt like I was just expected to know things, even though the course only has CMSC15400 as an explicit prerequisite.\\n– shan–yuan teng, our TA for this quarter, was absolutely amazing. I felt bad at times; there was so much work he did (sorting components for students, holding extra office hours for students before the final project was due, staying long hours passed what was required of him helping students). I'm not sure I could've gotten through this class without him. shan–yuan, if you're reading this by any chance, thank you so much! you're amazing.\\n– romain nith, a grad student in prof. lopes' lab, was taking this course this quarter but also acted as an unofficial TA. romain was also really helpful! romain, if you're reading this by any chance, thank you for taking the time to help students while also having to balance getting your own projects done! you're a kicad god.\\n– this class really needs an Ed, or at least something like it. communication is done via email, and it's difficult to keep track of all the emails sometimes. more importantly, I feel like students would benefit from a discussion forum where they could post their questions, which are often shared by other students. this would also take pressure off of the professor and TA(s), since students could help each other over Ed.\\n– there's a class wiki and a class website, each of which contain important information about the course. having information spread across two locations, coupled with communication being over email, made things confusing at times. (in case you're wondering: we did not have a canvas page for this course.)\\n– grades weren't really delivered back to us in a consistent manner, nor in a timely manner. grades were communicated over email. we were not given a breakdown of how much things would be weighted. for example, we did not receive information as to how much the final project was weighted; we were just told that it mattered a lot.\\n– in case it might be helpful information, we did not use a textbook in this course. the professor would post lecture slides on the class website after class.\",\n",
       "    \"Success on the final project required a TON of work outside of class, but also hinged on the PCB being correct when it was submitted to be made in a factory and sent back to us. We were told we would have multiple rounds of feedback to ensure what we submitted was correct, which we did, but then after they came back from the factory, some were told their PCB wouldn't work because of an error that should have been caught during the feedback session (it was too late at that point), even though during the feedback sessions they were told their PCB was good and ready to go. I think this happened because the prof and TA were totally over worked and spent many, many late nights getting everything together to make the assignments for this class happen. While I appreciate this, I think something is wrong if the Prof. and TA are totally overworked just by the logistics of the class, too much so to have time to give every student the feedback or help when things go wrong. I think the class needs to be redesigned so that the Prof. and TA don't have to work all day and night, skipping meals and sleep to just make the logistics of the class happen making it hard for them to give feedback or assistance to the students.\",\n",

This is to say nothing of the difficulty of C++ as a language and the complete nightmare that is debugging in Vulkan.\\n\\nUltimately the concepts were all very valuable to learn, and I'm glad I attended the lectures, but this course needs a SERIOUS overhaul of expectations before I would recommend any post–154 student try it.\",\n",

I often found myself learning more from the lecture notes posted by Professor Willett on Canvas instead.

Thus, there were some concepts in assignments that weren't covered at all in lecture, but the online lecture notes and videos were helpful for those.\\n\\nThe first half of the course (before the midterm) wasn't too hard, but some of the assignments after the midterm were extremely difficult. I felt like I spent more time just figuring out what the problem is asking for and comparatively very little time actually doing the problem.\",\n",
       "    \"The course material was interesting, but the administrative choices of the course made it an overall negative experience. First, grading. Homework assignments were not graded in a timely manner. We had 7 homework assignments in total, and only 4 were graded up by the time of the final. This made it difficult to understand how well you were doing in the class and how you should plan your time. For example, we had an optional extra credit assignment. The assignment itself was quite long, and it was difficult to decide whether or not to actually complete the extra credit since we didn't know our current standing in the course.\\nSecond, the TA sessions. TAs seemed like they had some degree of ownership over what material to cover in their sessions. In the last session leading up to the final, some TAs chose to go over the answers to the practice final while others decided to focus on other topics entirely. This might have been okay if not for the fact that they didn't release solutions to the practice final. I truly do not understand the motivation behind this decision. It felt like it actively harmed my learning and was overall detrimental to my preparation for the final.\\nThird, the quality of explanations to homeworks and topics. Linear algebra is not a prerequisite for this course, yet some homework answer keys utilized a deeper understanding of linear algebra beyond the scope of this course. Some of the TAs at several times also seemed unable to explain concepts in a simple way, and often fell back on using jargon and external knowledge to convey concepts.\",\n",

       "    \"Independently, both Professor Jonas and Willett are great as lecturers. But switching professors halfway through the quarter was problematic. The transition wasn't smooth – it seemed like we got an extra week of SVD and missed out on other key concepts that were recorded in previous year's lectures, making it difficult understand what we should be taking away from class and why we weren't covering the same topics as years prior.

Overall, this class felt lazily put together and lacked oversight. It seemed like these professors were so used to teaching it in the past they put no effort into writing decent homework and test questions. Also the distribution of material is odd; the first half of the course is learning least squares. The latter half is learning the rest of the topics. The staff is very defensive towards student complaints on Ed, or they don't acknowledge them at all. Someone is asleep behind the wheel.\",\n",
       "    \"Since the cours was co taught by 2 instructors, and the transition to 2nd instructor happens midway through a very critical topic SVD which is the bedrock for success in the course after midterm assignment, the transition by Prof Eric should have been handled better. I had to basically stop attending live lecture classes after I saw the instruction in his 1st class. Linear algebra requires a written instruction approach which explains the math and intuition of the derivations, and also explains the motivation behind where this particular topic gets used in real life application, and why is an algorithm better or worse than the previous algorithms taught in the course (i.e the value add). Prof Willett was 10/10 on this aspect because she was writing everything systematically after explaining the intuition of the math. However, Prof. Eric was somewhat unstructured and there were lot of gaps between what he taught versus what the recorded videos of Prof Willett from previous years taught. The inconsistency in his approach was echoed constantly on the Ed discussions. This adversely affected my time spent on this course because I had 2 watch 2 years of lecture videos on the same topics because even they didnt overlap 100% and after that I would have to check with Prof. Eric's class notes and my conclusion was that Prof. Eric's class notes were a subset. I appreciate the design of the final exam which was intended to assess whether students intuitively understood the concept or not, rather than testing us on who can do complex linear algebra proofs in the class.\",\n",
       "    \"I understand that it can be hard to predict the flow of the quarter, but it seems like Becca has this course down pat after doing it for several years – and yet we were not even close to finishing up the material when the quarter ended. In particular, we ended up spending a lot of time on LS and its variants and missing out on a lot of the exciting machine learning payoff at the end of the syllabus. It would be worth reevaluating how to avoid that issue in future years.\\n\\nMy other comment is that this course should absolutely NOT have the casual barriers to entry it does now. I am a second–year CAPP student who took linear algebra and machine learning last year, and yet simply completing the assignments routinely took me the entire weekend. Students with less preparation (specifically: no linear algebra background, little or no python) must have felt terribly overcome.

       "    \"This is the most POORLY ORGANIZED course that I've seen at UChicago. By its very construction, the course faces an unsolvable dilemma – trying to teach linear algebra without actually teaching linear algebra. The result is that the 1/2 of the class that has taken linear algebra is bored for half of the course and the 1/2 of the class that has not taken linear algebra is confused from the very beginning. The lectures are extremely superficial on linear algebra, which makes many of the problems in the homework and exams not make sense to students without prior knowledge. Furthermore, the office hours just make things worse because the TAs explain concepts at an extremely sophisticated level that requires an understanding of linear algebra. So students who haven't taken that class can't even benefit from the office hours. The TAs in office hours don't receive answers so just spend the entire session trying to figure out how to solve and explain the problems.\\n\\nThe result is that they end up confused on basic concepts that are taught in linear algebra but just glossed over in the course.\\n\\nStudents who have taken linear algebra are bored because around 50% of the material in the class is a repeat.\\n\\nSome of the homeworks were excessively and unnecessarily long. On the other hand, other homeworks were extremely short and did not ask any questions about key concepts in the course, thus not providing students any opportunity to engage with key material. The homework questions seem repeated from previous years, which is why some homeworks (like homeworks 6 and 7) did not ask about this year's material. The practice final exam was a repeat of old questions and thus was not useful at all.\\n\\nMy recommendation:\\na. Make this a linear algebra class like STAT 24300 with a little more focus on machine learning.\\nb. Make this a machine learning class that requires a basic understanding of linear algebra, allowing you to condense the first half of the course on least squares into ~ 2 weeks of review.\",\n",

If this is your first time doing a dedicated linear algebra course, it will be more challenging because the linear algebra is fast and the course is trying to get to other topics. Not impossible (and I think still worth it), but it will certainly be a more challenging class.\\n– In my opinion, this class is at its absolute best for people who have taken Abstract Linear Algebra and are comfortable with NumPy. Abstract does not cover enough to really pick up Machine Learning smoothly, but it does cover enough to make the early part of this course a gentle review of linear algebra, then an extremely fun foray into Applied linear algebra. Numerical Linear Algebra is also good, but might make more elements of this course redundant, especially if you've already seen the SVD.\",\n",

He denied my friend, who was in the ER all day investigating a potential appendicitis or kidney stone, even one day of an extension. My friend then spent another night taking a diuretic and trying to pass said kidney stone. He had to urinate through a sieve so that he could send the kidney stone to a lab. Jonas justified this by saying \"well, if I give you an extension then I have to give everyone an extension.\" He suggested that he use his \"drop,\" which is still a severe penalization.\\n\\nThere are a number of reasons why this is particularly disappointing and unfair. Firstly, does Eric Jonas think that everyone had a kidney stone that Thursday. Professors are authorized to use discretion when granting extensions. This is very poor discretion. He could have qualified such an extension by limiting the criteria to students suffering severe and acute medical emergencies.\\n\\nSecondly, professor Jonas seems to be discriminating on the basis of a temporary disability. The lack of any effort to find a reasonable accommodation demonstrates his lack of care for students.\\n\\nMy recommendation is that if you plan to take this class, don\\'t get sick. If you get sick, don\\'t count on professor Jonas caring.\\n\\nAgain: Don\\'t get sick. For any reason.\\n\\n\\nThe course was also poorly administered on the part of Jonas, Willet and the TAs. There are too many examples to list. One issue was that the lectures were not connected to a majority of the HW problems. One post on Ed got 60 likes just pointing this out. Another issue in the course were that, many (but not all) of the TAs were extraordinarily terse and/or unwilling to answer question. I was very surprised by the lack of motivation on the TAs part.\\n\\n\\nMost egregious, however, was that the day before the final (around 7 hours or so before the final to be specific, which was at 8PM), Jonas (presumably) turned off all commenting and posting on Ed. I would assume his justification would be that this was to reduce the questions being asked to TAs since they have finals. This is asinine. First of all, the army of 7 TAs could have distributed questions so that no one was overburdened. The TAs are paid University employees. Secondly, students can answer each others questions on Ed. It was bizarre to see the Ed page closed on the day before a final. I don\\'t know what the intent was.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I think Willet is a very good professor and was good at explaining things.

It was only after the first PSet was graded that I realized this was not the case. Then, when I figured out how it worked through practice and the help of TAs, I was alarmed by how something so simple could have been so badly explained in the lecture.\\n\\nThere were some topics from this course that I already knew, such as induction and combinatorics. Maybe because I learned these topics before from other teachers and had someone to compare Professor Rand to, the confusing nature of his explanations was all the more apparent. I felt bad for my classmates who were learning about these topics for the first time from Professor Rand. Topics that Professor Rand took a whole lecture to explain, my previous teachers were able to explain much more clearly and in a shorter amount of time.\\n\\nI felt like there were two reasons he was confusing in lectures:\\n1) He was explaining concepts that he was already very familiar with to a crowd that should be considered to be unfamiliar with them. In the first class, he noted that this was the \"curse of knowledge\" and that he would try to avoid this. Unfortunately, he did not avoid this well. In topics that I was previously familiar with, I would catch him making jumps that in my opinion should have been explained to new students.\\n2) He made up examples to explain concepts on the spot. While doing these examples he would often find that they were not as simple as he expected (and probably not the most appropriate example to introduce students to a specific concept). I was surprised to learn from an upperclassman friend that Professor Rand has been teaching this class for years (and in a similar manner).

He skims or skips critical topics that are unfamiliar and that really would be helped by more depth, and spends far too much time on topics that are either only tangentially relevant to the course, or far outside its scope (often both). He is wildly unhelpful in providing assistance to students, his homeworks are completely unpredictable in their difficulty and on occasion have assumed knowledge not found in this class or any of its prerequisites. In order to ask for help in this class, three people must publicly ask for a hint on a specific question, to which he will provide a \"hint\" that is either an outright solution, or actively unhelpful – aside from this, he is very unwilling to help his students. In fact, in making the course competitive, setting up this hint policy, and not providing much assistance in general, he is actively discouraging collaboration.\\nAs a final comment: you will not fail this class.

By week 9, we finally got the midterm graded (which was taken weeks earlier). We had to wait even further to get pset 3 graded– i just received it as of today, the monday of finals week. our final is in a couple of days and the tas already said they will be unable to get us our last two psets with feedback, and the third will likely be delivered a day before the final, if at all. feedback on the psets was sometimes too vague to be helpful, and sometimes it felt like an exorbitant amount of points were taken off for certain faults. this made for an overall very frustrating and exhausting experience in this class. how can we be expected to improve based on our mistakes if 1) we don't know what we messed up on and 2) if no one is responsive enough to answer our questions? thankfully answer keys were provided for some of the psets for the final. but at this point, i am just very exhausted and frustrated.\",\n",

We had homework due every week, but it took over a month to receive a grade and feedback on the homework assignments. When we did receive feedback, it was usually extremely harsh markdowns paired with one sentence of vague, copy/paste feedback. Some of the TA's also were completely unprepared/lacked the knowledge to help answer questions about the problem sets. This combination of things made it almost impossible to correct your mistakes to do better on the next homework/exams. We also constantly received conflicting information about how to structure our answers (ex: being told to write everything out and then being told that writing too much means your proof isn't rigorous and is probably wrong) which made it difficult to know what you were supposed to do.

       "    \"I can tell that Professor Morrisey puts in an effort to teach us (e.g. he's willing to push back pset deadlines when the class seemed confused, he pauses during lecture to ask if anyone has questions), so I really appreciate him for that because he's at least one of the professors who cares about students' learning, and I have faith he'll become a good professor with more experience.\\n\\nMy main constructive criticism is the lectures: the lectures were sometimes unclear and confusing, probably because logic is such a notation heavy course and the professor sometimes messes up notation on the board or not define what type of object something is before using it in a proof, and the small mistakes would just add up for me. He would also sometimes not explain certain things and I would assume something was one way only to realize that it was another way later. Usually when this happens in a course, I'm okay because we would be following a textbook, and I would just learn from the textbook instead of the professor's lectures. However, for this class, we don't follow any textbooks (Professor Morrisey does publish his lecture notes but I unfortunately don't find them any clearer than his lectures, especially because the details in many proofs were skipped, unlike how things are in textbooks), so I don't have that as a resource. And I know I wasn't the only one who found the lectures confusing, because I talked to other students in the class and it seemed like most people were pretty lost.\\n\\nProfessor Morrisey does mitigate the situation by pausing during lectures and asking if we have any questions, but towards the end of the course, I was so lost that I don't even know what questions to ask to improve my understanding. I think Professor Morrisey is really smart, and he understands the material very well himself, so it's easy to forget details when explaining things, which makes things confusing for students who have never seen any of this before.\\n\\nTo be fair, part of my struggles was also because I was taking a couple other math classes at the same time, so in the last two week, because this class got so confusing and it's less important to me than my other classes, I prioritized studying for my other classes over this class. I know that if I was willing to spend 20+hrs a week on this class, I would be able to master the material by self–studying. But I guess I just think if the lectures were better or if we were following a good textbook, then my life would be much easier.\",\n",

The homeworks seemed ok.\\n\\nI\\'m rather annoyed with the explanation of the generative models/LDA, not particularly at the teacher, but mainly at the fact that it seems that every textbook has something different to say about LDA / decision boundaries /fisher\\'s LDA, and I wish there was a bit more in the course tying together what was covered in lectures, and how similar material is talked about/explained in the textbook.\\n\\nI don\\'t know a single one of my peers who actually really truly understood what was really going on during the Gaussian Process lecture– it seemed rather out there, and just dropped the concept of a stochastic/gaussian process, and was actually rather difficult at first glance to see how it related to the kernel lectures preceding.\\n\\nIt\\'s difficult to complain about the homework assignments in particular, since I have not really taken a ML class before, so I don\\'t have a frame of reference. Perhaps all ML classes are this way, but it seems like all the \"theoretical\"/mathematical elements of the homework assignments weren\\'t more computational than anything. Aside from the one homework assignment question talking about the variance shrinking of ridge estimators, I feel like many of the homework questions (written) were simple to provide much intuition, and could probably have been given as recommended questions to do, with more challenging questions for the actual written portion. But I don\\'t suppose this is really too much to complain about.\\nAll in all, I don\\'t think it was a bad course though',\n",

Do the readings.\\n\\nThe programming component of this class is not particularly complex. There is an introduction to PyTorch but you won't be really be diving deep. Class is mostly about giving you a theoretical background. This is a consequence of the fact that it mixes CS and linguistics students. A lot of the programming exercises are about getting the linguistics students up to speed with Python. I honestly think that professors teaching electives shouldn't have to be walking students through the basics of programming. But that's a problem with how UChicago organizes the humanities/social sciences, not the fault of Prof. Ettinger. Long past due that there was a specific set of core programming courses for the social sciences/humanities.\\n\\nFamiliarity with the basics of linear algebra will be helpful.

However, I was personally expecting a class with more coding and implementation rather than a reading/discussion post/discussion based class. It ended up feeling more like a SOSC/Humanities class as a result. The concepts discussed were interesting, but reading and talking about other people’s research only takes you so far.',\n",
       "    'This course was underwhelming in every dimension. My frustration with the class is largely a result of how lectures were structured. Instead of covering the technical details of different language models, or teachnig us how to implement them in Python, the class is primarily discussion–based. Since discussion is graded, lots of people felt pressured to speak in class, which resulted in the same comment being reiterated multiple times. This became worse after intermediate participation grades were released and lots of students got an underwhelming grade. As a function of class size (50+ students) and how the class is designed, excessive emphasis (and pressure) was put on students having to talk if they wanted decent grades. A few students went rogue (the two that come to mind both sat in the front row) and repeatedly talked without putting their hand up, or without contributing anything meaningful to the conversation. This lead to a dysfunctional environment. Particularly in the second half of the class, I only went to lectures to make sure I get credit for participation, I did not learn from some of my peers rambling on about topics that are tangentially related to the course materials. I would have preferred to learn about computational linguistics from the instructor instead. I am leaving the class disheartened. My goal was to learn more about computational linguistics in terms of both theory and code, but unfortunately, I failed to achieve either goal. I am also still waiting on feedback on my assignment that I submitted in week 2, exactly two months ago.
